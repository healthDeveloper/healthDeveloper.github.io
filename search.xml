        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Preventing and treating hemorrhoids is not difficult</p><a id="more"></a><h1 id="What-are-hemorrhoids"><a href="#What-are-hemorrhoids" class="headerlink" title="What are hemorrhoids?"></a>What are hemorrhoids?</h1><p><img src="https://s2.loli.net/2023/09/21/eJ216jW9Msy7dGS.png" alt="image.png"></p><p>Hemorrhoids are dilated and swollen blood vessels inside the anus and rectum.</p><p>Hemorrhoids are basically harmless, but the symptoms caused by hemorrhoids can be uncomfortable and even frightening (such as bleeding during a bowel movement).</p><p>Risk factors for hemorrhoids</p><p>Hemorrhoids are very common and can occur at any age. Hemorrhoids can also be caused by straining too hard during a bowel movement or sitting on the toilet for long periods of time. Pregnant women are also at high risk of hemorrhoids. This is due to the increased pressure on the rectum and anus as the embryo grows. This is coupled with the fact that during the delivery process, the pregnant woman has to exert force, which will also result in additional pressure on the rectum and anus. Pregnant women are also more prone to constipation due to frequent intake of health supplements such as iron tablets.</p><p>People who are sedentary or do not consume enough water, vegetables and fruits are also more likely to develop hemorrhoids. In addition, those who need to exercise frequently, such as squatting or lifting weights, also have a higher chance of developing hemorrhoids.</p><h1 id="What-are-the-symptoms-of-hemorrhoids"><a href="#What-are-the-symptoms-of-hemorrhoids" class="headerlink" title="What are the symptoms of hemorrhoids?"></a>What are the symptoms of hemorrhoids?</h1><p><img src="https://s2.loli.net/2023/09/21/j7BNetaoUgWnpDc.png" alt="image.png"></p><p>Hemorrhoid symptoms will depend on the specific type of hemorrhoid, but common symptoms include:</p><p>Pain and itching around the anus<br>Bleeding during bowel movements<br>Swelling in and around the anus<br>Mucus production</p><h1 id="Types-of-Hemorrhoids"><a href="#Types-of-Hemorrhoids" class="headerlink" title="Types of Hemorrhoids"></a>Types of Hemorrhoids</h1><p>Hemorrhoids are usually categorized into 3 main types:</p><p>Internal Hemorrhoids:</p><p>Internal hemorrhoids form inside the anus and are classified into 4 grades.</p><p>Grade 1 hemorrhoids, which do not prolapse from the anus during a bowel movement<br>Grade 2 hemorrhoids, which prolapse from the anus during a bowel movement, but then retract automatically.<br>Grade 3 hemorrhoids, which protrude out of the anus during bowel movements and need to be pushed back into the anus by hand.<br>Grade IV hemorrhoids, which protrude out of the anus and cannot be pushed back in.<br>External hemorrhoids:</p><p>External hemorrhoids are lumps that occur around the anus and are usually more visible than internal hemorrhoids.</p><p>Thrombosed hemorrhoids:</p><p>This is a complication of hemorrhoids that occurs as a result of blood clots that form in external hemorrhoids. Severe pain, itching and bleeding are all common symptoms of thrombosed hemorrhoids.</p><h1 id="How-to-prevent-hemorrhoids"><a href="#How-to-prevent-hemorrhoids" class="headerlink" title="How to prevent hemorrhoids"></a>How to prevent hemorrhoids</h1><p>The best way to prevent hemorrhoids is to keep stools soft and easy to pass. To prevent hemorrhoids and reduce the symptoms of hemorrhoids, the following should be followed:</p><p>Eat high-fiber foods. Eat plenty of fruits, vegetables and whole grains. This will soften your stool, add bulk to it, and help you avoid excessive straining that can cause hemorrhoids. Do add fiber to your meals gradually to avoid bloating problems.<br>Consume more fluids. Drink six to eight glasses of water and other fluids (non-alcoholic) daily to keep your stools soft.<br>Consider fiber supplements. Most people don’t get the recommended amount of fiber in their diets, which is 20 to 30 grams a day. Studies have shown that over-the-counter fiber supplements such as psyllium (Metamucil) or methylcellulose (Citrucel) can improve the overall symptoms of hemorrhoids and bleeding.</p><p>If you take fiber supplements, you should drink at least eight glasses of water or other fluids each day. Otherwise, these supplements may cause or worsen constipation.</p><p>Don’t push to have a bowel movement. Excessive straining and holding your breath when trying to have a bowel movement can cause more pressure on the veins in the lower rectum.<br>Use the toilet as soon as you have a bowel movement. If you wait a while to have a bowel movement, the urge will disappear and the stool will become dry and more difficult to pass.<br>Exercise. Staying active helps prevent constipation and reduces the pressure on your veins from standing or sitting for long periods of time. Exercise also helps you lose weight and avoid hemorrhoids.<br>Avoid sitting. Sitting for long periods of time, especially while using the toilet, can increase pressure on the anal veins.</p><h1 id="Hemorrhoid-Treatment"><a href="#Hemorrhoid-Treatment" class="headerlink" title="# Hemorrhoid Treatment"></a># Hemorrhoid Treatment</h1><p>Treatment for hemorrhoids will depend on the type, location, and size of the hemorrhoids, as well as their severity. Not all hemorrhoid conditions need to be treated with surgery.</p><h2 id="Diet-and-lifestyle-modifications"><a href="#Diet-and-lifestyle-modifications" class="headerlink" title="Diet and lifestyle modifications"></a>Diet and lifestyle modifications</h2><p>For mild cases of hemorrhoids, relief can be found through simple diet and lifestyle changes:</p><p>Increase fiber intake and drink moderate amounts of water to prevent constipation<br>Sitz baths or cold compresses can help reduce pain and swelling.<br>Avoid excessive straining during bowel movements<br>Maintain a healthy weight to avoid putting pressure around the anus and rectal veins.<br>Exercise regularly and avoid sedentary lifestyle</p><h2 id="Oral-and-topical-medications"><a href="#Oral-and-topical-medications" class="headerlink" title="Oral and topical medications"></a>Oral and topical medications</h2><p>Oral and topical medications can be used for mild to moderate cases of hemorrhoids:</p><p>Stabilize blood vessel walls to reduce the risk of injury<br>Soften stools to avoid straining during defecation<br>Promote bowel movement to prevent constipation<br>Relieve pain, swelling and inflammation caused by hemorrhoids<br>Relieves pain around the anus<br>Reduces discomfort caused by pain and itching<br>Minimally invasive hemorrhoid treatment</p><p>Minimally invasive surgery may be considered for severe cases of hemorrhoids that do not respond to non-surgical treatments such as lifestyle modifications and medications. This includes:</p><p>Rubber band ligation:</p><p>Rubber band ligation is indicated for first to second degree hemorrhoids. For the procedure, a rubber band will be placed around the base of the hemorrhoid to cut off the blood supply to the hemorrhoid. This causes the hemorrhoids to shrink and fall off within a few days.</p><p>Injection Therapy (Sclerotherapy):</p><p>This treatment will use a special solution that will be injected into the hemorrhoid to make it shrink.</p><p>Coagulation therapy:</p><p>This treatment uses laser, infrared light or heat to harden and shrink the internal hemorrhoids.</p><p>Hemorrhoid Surgery</p><p>In severe cases, such as symptomatic grade III or IV hemorrhoids, hemorrhoids that cause recurrent bleeding and accompanying complications (e.g., anemia), surgery may be performed to completely remove the hemorrhoids.</p><p>Traditional Hemorrhoidectomy:</p><p>Traditional hemorrhoidectomy is the most effective treatment for severe or recurrent hemorrhoids. This treatment will remove the hemorrhoids through electrocautery.</p><p>Circumferential hemorrhoidectomy:</p><p>This surgical procedure will use an anastomosis to remove excess hemorrhoidal tissue. It also helps to restore the hemorrhoids to their original position within the anal canal.</p><p>Laser Hemorrhoidectomy:</p><p>Laser Haemorrhoidectomy is a newer surgical treatment in Singapore that uses laser fibers to release laser energy on the hemorrhoids. This procedure causes less postoperative discomfort, however it is only applicable to certain types of hemorrhoids.</p>]]></content>

      <title>How to treat premature ejaculation and improvement of sexual performance?</title>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Premature ejaculation is when a man ejaculates earlier during sexual intercourse than he or his partner thought he would. It usually causes stress for both the man and his partner as neither of them gets satisfaction from the intercourse.</p><a id="more"></a><p><img src="https://s2.loli.net/2023/09/20/fdYiGAIFRTL64bx.png" alt="image.png"></p><p>Weak pelvic floor muscles may make it difficult to delay ejaculation. Pelvic floor exercises (Kegel exercises) help to strengthen these muscles.</p><h1 id="To-perform-these-exercises-to-improve-sexual-performance"><a href="#To-perform-these-exercises-to-improve-sexual-performance" class="headerlink" title="To perform these exercises to improve sexual performance:"></a>To perform these exercises to improve sexual performance:</h1><p>Find the right muscles. To find where the pelvic floor muscles are, stop midway through urination. Or tighten the muscle that stops the anus from passing gas. Both of these movements use the pelvic floor muscles. Once you have found the pelvic floor muscle, you can perform the exercise in any position. You may find it easier to do it lying down at first, though.<br>Perfecting the technique. Tighten the pelvic floor muscles, hold for three seconds, then relax for three seconds. Try this several times in a row. As the muscles get stronger, try performing Kegel exercises while sitting, standing or walking.<br>Stay focused. For best results, focus on tightening only your pelvic floor muscles. Be careful not to contract your abdominal, thigh or buttock muscles. Do not hold your breath. Instead, breathe freely during the exercise.<br>Repeat three times a day. Perform at least three sets of 10 repetitions per day.<br>Pause-squeeze technique<br>Your healthcare provider can instruct you and your partner in a pause-squeeze technique. The process is as follows:</p><p>Begin sexual intercourse, including stimulating the penis, until you feel almost ready to ejaculate.<br>You or your partner can then squeeze the end of the penis (where the head meets the body). Keep squeezing for a few seconds until the feeling of wanting to ejaculate disappears.<br>Repeat the squeezing process as needed.<br>After several repetitions, you can successfully enter your partner without ejaculating. After several practices, delayed ejaculation may become a habit and the pause-squeeze technique may no longer be necessary.</p><p>If the Pause-Squeeze technique causes pain or discomfort, you can try the Stop-Start technique. This technique stops sexual stimulation before ejaculation. It then waits until the sexual urge wears off before starting again.</p><h1 id="Use-condoms-to-prevent-premature-ejaculation"><a href="#Use-condoms-to-prevent-premature-ejaculation" class="headerlink" title="Use condoms to prevent premature ejaculation"></a>Use condoms to prevent premature ejaculation</h1><p>Condoms may help delay ejaculation by reducing the sensitivity of the penis. Specially designed “orgasm control” condoms are available without a prescription. These condoms contain an anesthetic, such as benzocaine or lidocaine, and are designed to delay ejaculation. These condoms may also be made of thicker latex. Examples include Trojan Extended Pleasure and Durex Prolong.</p><h1 id="Medication-for-premature-ejaculation"><a href="#Medication-for-premature-ejaculation" class="headerlink" title="Medication for premature ejaculation"></a>Medication for premature ejaculation</h1><h2 id="Local-anesthetics"><a href="#Local-anesthetics" class="headerlink" title="Local anesthetics"></a>Local anesthetics</h2><p>Anesthetic creams, gels, and sprays containing anesthetic agents such as benzocaine, lidocaine, or proparacaine are sometimes used to treat premature ejaculation. These products are applied to the penis 10 to 15 minutes before sex to reduce sensation and help delay ejaculation. These medications are available without a prescription. However, creams containing lidocaine and proparacaine (EMLA) require a prescription.</p><p>Although local anesthetics are effective and well tolerated, there are potential side effects that may reduce sensation and sexual pleasure for both partners.</p><h2 id="Oral-medications"><a href="#Oral-medications" class="headerlink" title="Oral medications"></a>Oral medications</h2><p>Many medications can delay orgasm. Although these medications are not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of premature ejaculation, some may be used for this purpose, including antidepressants, analgesics, and anti-erectile dysfunction medications.</p><p>These medications can be prescribed for on-demand or daily use and can be used alone or in combination with other therapies.</p><p>Antidepressants. A side effect of certain antidepressants is delayed orgasm. For this reason, premature ejaculation can be treated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).SSRIs include paroxetine (Paxil, Pexeva, Brisdelle), escitalopram (Lexapro), citalopram (Celexa), sertraline (Zoloft) or fluoxetine (Prozac).</p><p>In some countries, the SSRI dapoxetine is often used as first-line treatment for premature ejaculation. It is not currently available in the United States.</p><p>Of the medications approved for use in the United States, paroxetine appears to be the most effective. These medications usually take 5-10 days to start working. However, it may take 2 to 3 weeks of treatment to see the full effect.</p><p>If an SSRI does not improve ejaculation time, medical personnel may prescribe the tricyclic antidepressant clomipramine (Anafranil). Antidepressants may have side effects such as nausea, sweating, drowsiness, and loss of libido.</p><p>Pain medications. Tramadol (Ultram, Conzip, Qdolo) is a medication used to treat pain. It also has the side effect of delaying ejaculation. Tramadol may be prescribed if an SSRI does not work. Tramadol should not be used in combination with an SSRI.</p><p>Side effects may include nausea, headache, drowsiness, and dizziness. Tramadol can be addictive when taken for long periods of time.</p><h3 id="Phosphodiesterase-5-inhibitors"><a href="#Phosphodiesterase-5-inhibitors" class="headerlink" title="Phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors."></a>Phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors.</h3><p>Some medications used to treat erectile dysfunction may also help treat premature ejaculation. Such medications include sildenafil (Viagra), tadalafil (Cialis, Adcirca), avanafil (Stendra), and vardenafil. Side effects may include headache, facial flushing, and indigestion. These medications may be more effective when combined with an SSRI.<br>Possible future treatments<br>Research suggests that a variety of medications may help treat premature ejaculation, but more research is needed on this. These medications include:</p><h3 id="Modafinil-Provigil"><a href="#Modafinil-Provigil" class="headerlink" title="Modafinil (Provigil)."></a>Modafinil (Provigil).</h3><p>This is a treatment for the sleep disorder episodic somnolence.<br>Serodosin (Rapaflo). This medicine treats enlarged prostate.<br>Botulinum toxin type A (Botox). Researchers are studying whether injecting botulinum toxin into the muscles that help ejaculation can treat premature ejaculation.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Many people with symptoms of depression do not think they suffer from depression. Some people do not realize that they are suffering from depression, while others do not want to admit that they are suffering from depression. When it comes to depression, many people will find it difficult to talk about it, they will feel like a failure and worry about being judged by others. But we need to recognize this: depression is a very common illness for caregivers, and is a normal reaction that people have in times of distress. Carers face ongoing care needs as they provide care, so it is not unusual for them to suffer from mild or more severe depression.</p><a id="more"></a><p><img src="https://s2.loli.net/2023/09/19/WL15rokIn4De82d.png" alt="image.png"></p><p>Depression is a very complex disorder that requires a great deal of research to identify the cause. Known contributing factors include genetic traits, hormone levels, environmental triggers, certain medications, the effects of a major illness, grief and confusion due to the death of a loved one, physical or emotional abuse, and living with a person with major depression. Not everyone has the negative feelings that come with depression. But we do know that caregivers often sacrifice their own physical and emotional needs in order to provide the best possible care for a family member or friend. In providing care, there are a variety of complex and changing situations that can be extremely stressful for even the most capable person. Emotions such as overwhelm, restlessness, anxiety, pain, pessimism, loneliness, and exhaustion - and even guilt for having them - can have serious consequences.</p><p>Everyone has negative thoughts or feelings that normally fade away over time, but when these feelings grow stronger and leave you feeling depleted, easily sad or angry at loved ones, it can be a warning sign of depression. When you always feel empty, want to cry, or when these emotions always linger, it is important to be aware that you may be suffering from depression.</p><p>However, it is common for people to think of depression as a sign of weakness, not realizing that it could indicate an imbalance of some kind. Other people’s advice, such as “pick yourself up” or “it’s all in your head”, is not helpful and reflects a disregard for their mental health. Ignoring or denying your feelings will not make them go away.</p><p>Early attention to depression symptoms, through exercise, healthy eating, support from family or friends, or consultation with a health or mental health professional can prevent depression from worsening.</p><h1 id="Symptoms-of-Depression"><a href="#Symptoms-of-Depression" class="headerlink" title="Symptoms of Depression"></a>Symptoms of Depression</h1><p><img src="https://s2.loli.net/2023/09/19/Xdq3yGgfnA1OEYR.png" alt="image.png"></p><p>Every person with depression has different symptoms. Some people may have typical symptoms of depression, such as sadness and despair. Some people may have symptoms that don’t make them realize they have depression, such as extreme fatigue or irritability. The type and degree of symptoms vary from person to person and may change over time. The following are common symptoms of depression. Have you had any of the following feelings for more than two weeks?</p><p>Feeling sad, wanting to cry, empty, hopeless<br>Changes in eating habits - weight loss, lack of appetite or craving for weight gain<br>Changes in sleep - sleeping too much or not enough<br>Feeling tired all the time and not wanting to do anything<br>Losing interest in people and/or activities that used to bring you joy<br>Feeling numb<br>Becoming easily agitated or angry<br>Feeling like you can’t do anything right<br>Becoming more dependent on alcohol or drugs<br>Spending too much time online<br>Difficulty concentrating, thinking or planning - always feeling confused<br>Not taking care of your physical health and appearance<br>Wanting to escape from the current situation<br>Thoughts of death or suicide, thinking about how to end your life<br>Persistence of certain physical symptoms despite treatment, such as headaches, digestive disorders, and chronic neck and back pain<br>Difficulties faced by caregivers<br>Caring for a person with ADHD can be time-consuming and labor-intensive. Researchers have found that caregivers of people with dementia are twice as likely to suffer from depression as caregivers of people with other conditions. Not only do caregivers of people with degenerative brain disorders have to spend more hours per week providing care, but they also face more serious employment problems, personal stress, mental and physical health issues, are prone to sleep deprivation, don’t have enough time to do their favorite things or spend time with other family members, and have more family conflicts than caregivers of people with other illnesses.<br>The deterioration of a loved one’s mental and physical abilities is already a huge stressor for the caregiver, and caring for a person with degenerative brain disease makes it even more likely that the caregiver will suffer from depression. Symptoms of dementia such as wandering, restlessness, hoarding, embarrassing behaviors, refusal or non-cooperation with a loved one’s care, and more make each day difficult for the caregiver, making it difficult to get a break or get help. The more severe the condition of the person with dementia, the greater the likelihood that the caregiver will suffer from depression. It is important for caregivers, especially those facing the conditions described above, to have consistent and reliable support and proper rest.</p><p>Women have a higher rate of depression than men. The majority of caregivers are women, primarily wives and daughters. In the U.S., about 12 million women suffer from clinical depression each year, about twice the rate of men. If you think depression is just the result of rumination, you are mistaken. Depression can be caused by menopause, childbirth, premenstrual symptoms (PMS), thyroid disease, and nutritional deficiencies due to lack of iron, vitamin D, and omega-3 fatty acids.<br>A study by Mental Health America found that many women refuse treatment for depression because they are embarrassed or don’t want to admit they are depressed. In fact, 41% of the women surveyed cited embarrassment as the main factor preventing them from getting treatment. Remember, doctors already know a lot about depression. Getting a thorough physical examination is important for both your mental and physical health. If you suspect you have symptoms of depression, talk to your doctor during your exam.</p><p>Male caregivers approach depression differently than women. Men are more reluctant to admit that they are depressed and it is more difficult for doctors to diagnose depression in men than in women. Men are more likely to “self-medicate” with alcohol or overwork when faced with symptoms of depression such as anger, irritability or feelings of powerlessness. Male caregivers are more likely than female caregivers to hire others to help with home care, but they lack friends to talk to or positive activities outside the home. Misperceiving depression as a sign of weakness is a major factor that prevents men with depression from seeking help.</p><p>Military and veteran caregivers are at risk for depression. Military and veteran caregivers have almost twice the rate of depression as other caregivers. The poorer the veteran’s mental and/or physical health, the more demands the caregiver faces. Caregivers of individuals with conditions such as dementia, traumatic brain injury (TBI), and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) face particularly difficult circumstances. They have to cope with day-to-day life in addition to preventing veterans from becoming irritated and helping them cope with their own mental stress, all of which can be overwhelming and exacerbate depression, especially feelings of hopelessness and despair. Military caregivers may have a hard time finding someone who also has experience caring for a service member, especially younger caregivers, whose peers are hardly likely to face the same challenges. You may have even moved to an area with easier access to VA benefits or greater assistance for veterans, where you may feel more isolated and have a harder time getting help from friends. But that doesn’t mean you can’t get any help. First, you need to talk to your doctor, who can refer you to a mental health professional and also prescribe medication on a case-by-case basis.<br>Lack of sleep can lead to depression. Everyone needs a different amount of sleep, but most people need eight hours a day. Sleep deprivation due to caring for a loved one can trigger severe depression. Remember, even if you can’t keep your loved one resting soundly throughout the night, you can make sure you get as much sleep as you need. Hiring a short-term caregiver or having a friend stay with your loved one and take a nap yourself, finding a daycare center or arranging for other family members to stay overnight for a few nights can help you get enough sleep while watching over your loved one.</p><p>Depression may persist after placing a loved one in a care facility. The decision to place a loved one in a care center can be extremely stressful for the caregiver. After this, many caregivers are able to get enough rest, but the internal feelings of loneliness, guilt, and worry about what will happen to their loved one in the care facility can bring on new stress. Many caregivers feel depressed when they place their loved one in a care facility, and some continue to feel depressed for some time.<br>It is assumed that once the caregiving ends, the stress associated with providing care in person will disappear. However, researchers have found that even three years after the death of a spouse with a degenerative brain disease, some former caregivers continue to feel depressed and lonely. In order to return to normal life, former caregivers may also need to be treated for depression.</p><p>What to do if you think you have depression<br>Like any other condition such as diabetes or high blood pressure, depression should be given the same amount of attention. Again, the best way to find the cause is to talk to a qualified professional, such as a doctor. If using the word “depression” makes you feel uncomfortable, you can tell your doctor that you are “depressed” or “feeling down” and tell him or her about your experiences and symptoms. Tell your doctor about your experiences and symptoms. The more specific the information you give, the more effective the help you will receive. It is important that you focus on this issue when you meet with your doctor and communicate as openly as possible so that he or she can help you.</p><p>People receiving care are also susceptible to depression. Anything can seem worse to them than it actually is, and this can make your day-to-day caregiving more difficult. If you suspect that a loved one in your care is suffering from depression, find an opportunity to express your concerns to them. If they are reluctant to talk to you about it, find a trusted friend to talk to them, or consider leaving a message with your doctor about your concerns before your next appointment with them.   </p><h1 id="How-is-depression-treated"><a href="#How-is-depression-treated" class="headerlink" title="How is depression treated?"></a>How is depression treated?</h1><p>The most effective way to treat depression starts with talking to a mental health professional such as a psychiatrist, social worker, or other licensed therapist. Also, have your doctor schedule a physical exam for you. Certain medications, as well as certain illnesses (e.g., viral infections) can cause the same symptoms as depression and should be determined by your doctor. The physical exam should include laboratory tests and an interview to test mental status and determine if speech, memory, or thought patterns are affected.</p><p>While your doctor may prescribe antidepressants, medication alone is not the most effective treatment for depression. It is highly recommended to work with a mental health professional at the same time. A therapist or professional counselor will listen to your concerns, identify your depressive symptoms, and assist you in finding ways to relieve stress and develop a new coping plan.</p><p>You can ask a friend for a referral to a reliable professional, ask a pastor or clergyman, or your doctor, or if you are employed, check your employer’s list of health insurance providers or the Employee Assistance Program (EAP). In addition, you can get contact information for mental health professionals in your community from state agencies. (See “Finding a Professional in Your Area” in this resource book.)</p><p>It is important for you to trust and accept a mental health professional. You can usually ask for a free, no-obligation phone or in-person referral to see if the professional can meet your specific needs and behaviors. Specifically, this should include the following:</p><h1 id="How-much-it-will-cost"><a href="#How-much-it-will-cost" class="headerlink" title="How much it will cost"></a>How much it will cost</h1><p>How much your insurance will cover<br>How many times you expect to need to meet with this mental health therapist<br> Any treatment will need to be evaluated on a regular basis to ensure that this treatment continues to help you improve your health.</p><h2 id="The-treatment-program"><a href="#The-treatment-program" class="headerlink" title="The treatment program"></a>The treatment program</h2><p>After reviewing your physical and mental health assessment, the therapist may recommend a treatment program. The main treatment options include psychotherapy (also known as mental health therapy and talk therapy) and antidepressant medication. You may need to choose a particular treatment program, or you may need a combination of treatment programs. For depressive symptoms that have progressed to a severe stage, the most common treatment option is antidepressant medication, which provides faster relief of symptoms. The key to depression treatment is to use both psychotherapy and medication. By talking about your situation with a therapist, you can gain new insights into one of your emotional problems, and the therapist will be able to guide you through the process, helping you to overcome difficulties and restore and maintain your physical and mental health.</p><p>When choosing a therapist, be sure to ask about their experience helping family caregivers and their understanding of the stressors associated with caregiving.</p><p>If the therapist suggests medication, it will take a certain amount of trial and error to find the right type and dosage of medication for you as an individual, and it may take several weeks to see results. Good communication between patient and doctor is very important. Middle-aged and older adults should be especially careful to watch for side effects of medications due to high doses or interactions with other medications.</p><h2 id="Supplements-and-alternative-therapies"><a href="#Supplements-and-alternative-therapies" class="headerlink" title="Supplements and alternative therapies"></a>Supplements and alternative therapies</h2><p>There are many supplemental medications and alternative therapies on the market that claim to treat depression. Some have passed scientific clinical trials, but most have not. Here are some of the most common therapies:</p><p>Physical exercise: It has been proven that physical exercise does have a role in relieving depression. Walking for 30 to 45 minutes three times a week can reduce or alleviate depressive symptoms. If you don’t have that kind of time, you can start with a 15-minute walk once a week. The key is to get into the habit of exercising regularly.</p><p>It is not known whether physical activity can prevent depressive episodes or whether it only helps to improve symptoms. It is sometimes difficult for caregivers to make time for exercise. Physical activity is often seen as a “value-added” activity that people do after they have done everything else. You can add physical activity to your “to-do” list, ask a friend to designate a weekly “walk day” as a gift, or ask your doctor to write a prescription for a walk or physical education class. Studies show that it makes sense to take time to exercise for a healthier life.</p><p>Mind-Body Regulation: A growing body of research shows that our thoughts, beliefs, and feelings have a direct impact on our health, and our physical health can affect our mental state. Your mind and body are interconnected. Applying mind-body modification to your daily life may help relieve depression.</p><p>It only takes 5 to 10 minutes to make a difference. Here are some things you can try:</p><p>Meditation<br>Prayer<br>Deep breathing<br>Acupuncture<br>Yoga<br>Massage<br>Listening to music<br>Artistic creation<br>Guided imagery<br>Journaling<br>Supplements: “Over-the-counter” herbs such as St. John’s Wart/Hypericum perforatum and other supplements (e.g., SAMe and omega-3 fatty acids) are being researched and/or have been used extensively in the U.S. and Europe to treat depression. are being researched and/or are already widely used in the U.S. and Europe for the treatment of depression. Currently, for over-the-counter medications in the United States, there are no established standards for the amount of active ingredients in a product or the appropriate dosage. The effectiveness of products is difficult to determine and some products may cause side effects. For example, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued a warning that St. John’s wort may affect the metabolic pathways of many prescription drugs, including those used to treat heart disease, depression, and AIDS.</p><p>If you are taking or are planning to take any herbal supplements, contact your healthcare practitioner to make sure that these herbal supplements will not interfere with any other treatment you are receiving.</p><p>Light therapy: If a caregiver feels “blue” indoors or when the skies are gray in the winter, they may have Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD), also known as “winter depression. The seasonal affective disorder (SAD), also known as “winter depression”. As the seasons change, the body’s biological clock, or circadian rhythm, changes, in part due to changes in sunlight patterns. This can cause our biological clocks to be out of sync with our daily schedules. people with SAD have a difficult time adjusting to the lack of daylight in the winter months. symptoms of SAD are most noticeable in January and February, when daylight hours are shortest. SAD is often misdiagnosed as hypothyroidism, hypoglycemia, infectious mononuclear leukocytosis, and other viral infections.</p><p>Light therapy (i.e., treatment with specially designed fluorescent lights) has been shown to alleviate symptoms of depression in people with SAD. Experts believe that light therapy is able to alter the levels of certain chemicals in the brain, particularly melatonin, to achieve therapeutic goals. Antidepressant medications, as well as other treatments such as exercise, can also be helpful in relieving depression. If you have mild symptoms of seasonal depression, try using a lamp or other light source to increase the intensity of light around you. If your symptoms are so severe that they are interfering with your normal work and life, seek help from a mental health professional who specializes in SAD treatment.</p><h1 id="Treatment-Costs"><a href="#Treatment-Costs" class="headerlink" title="Treatment Costs"></a>Treatment Costs</h1><p>Individual health insurance and Medicare can cover some of the cost of mental health care, and the Affordable Care Act (ACA) has expanded coverage for mental health benefits. Policies vary widely from one insurance policy to another, so it’s best to contact a mental health professional directly to ask if they accept payment through your insurance. Health insurance companies usually list mental health professionals among the doctors who list health plans. Booklet titled “Medicare and Mental Health Benefits”</p>]]></content>

      <title>How to effectively treat AIDS</title>

      <url>/2023/09/17/health-33/</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Utilizing Traditional Chinese Medicine in the Treatment of AIDS</p><a id="more"></a><p><img src="https://s2.loli.net/2023/09/17/huO3G8JodWDcl2e.png" alt="image.png"></p><p>At present, the treatment of AIDS is, on the one hand, to inhibit the virus and enhance the immune function, and on the other hand, to fight against infection and tumors, to alleviate the symptoms and prolong the life. Now the most commonly used drugs are azidothymidine, dideoxyinosine and dideoxycytidine, etc. According to the relevant data, in the early stage of infection, such as the combined use of the above drugs will have a better effect. However, all of the above drugs are produced abroad, and the price is very expensive, rarely used in China. Other immunomodulatory drugs include interferon, interleukin and gammaglobulin, etc., all of which have the functions of anti-virus, anti-bacterial infection and enhancement of immunomodulation. Among them, interleukin can also increase the number of lymphocytes in patients and improve the immune function of human body.</p><pre><code>    　　Treatment of traditional Chinese medicine: From the recognition of traditional Chinese medicine, AIDS is caused by the external evil (the evil of warmth and epidemic) of the virus invading the body. External evils invade the body, the positive does not overcome the evil, basically belongs to the false evidence, although sometimes manifested as this false standard, but still mainly false, so in general, the treatment should be &quot;support the positive and benefit the yin&quot; as the main, it is appropriate to supplement rather than to diarrhea, according to the involvement of the lungs, spleen, kidneys and so on, respectively, to tonify the qi and benefit the lungs, warming the middle and strengthening the spleen, training and tonifying the spleen and kidneys, and at the same time, to clear away the heat, transform the phlegm, eliminate the dampness, extinguish the wind, and suppress the alarm, and so on, and the choice of various formulas. In traditional Chinese medicine, Zihuadidin, Salvia miltiorrhiza and Licorice have some anti-HIV effects. GLD223 extracted from the pollen of smallpox, and then proved to have a strong anti-HIV effect in the experiment, to be introduced by the U.S. FDA to the anti-AIDS clinical verification of drugs, into the second phase of clinical trials. There is no optimistic news about the treatment of AIDS. American-Chinese scientist He Dayi invented a combination of drug therapy &quot;cocktail therapy&quot; was a sensation, but now research has found that even the simultaneous use of three or even four kinds of drugs can not be completely clear of HIV in the human body. On the contrary, the number of the virus may increase dramatically after incubating in the body for a period of time. What&#39;s more, the astronomical annual cost of such treatment is beyond the reach of most patients in developing countries. According to experts, very few patients in China are now treated with regular medication, and each of them spends 200,000 to 300,000 yuan a year or more. For this reason, experts in Beijing, Shanghai and other places are targeting the field of traditional Chinese medicine, trying to find drugs that can effectively inhibit the virus and repair the body&#39;s immunity, while also being very cheap.    　　The American Chemical and Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers Association, a survey shows that dozens of chemical and pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies in the United States are currently experimenting with 113 kinds of new drugs for the treatment of AIDS and related symptoms. Homo, chairman of the board of directors of the ACCP, said the ongoing research will add new tools to the fight against AIDS. Fifty-four drugs have already been approved for the treatment of AIDS and related symptoms. Thanks to the new drugs, the U.S. AIDS death rate was cut nearly in half last year, but 40,000 people in the U.S. are still infected with the disease each year, Homo said.    　　Many diseases that have seriously threatened human health throughout history have been controlled or even eliminated by the development of effective vaccines, such as smallpox, polio and measles. However, no successful or near-successful AIDS vaccine has yet been developed. Although U.S. President Bill Clinton put the 10-year plan to develop an AIDS vaccine on the same level of importance as that year&#39;s moon landing program, there has been no breakthrough in the development of the vaccine so far.</code></pre>]]></content>

After the age of 30, testosterone will decline at a rate of 1-2% per year. When our testosterone levels decline, the body’s ability to regulate insulin, glucose, and fat metabolism will decrease, which will lead to fat accumulation, and a decrease in testosterone also means a decrease in the efficiency of muscle synthesis. Regular strength training with cardio can help you lose weight and shed non-essential fat. Fat loss will reduce estrogen production and testosterone levels will naturally pull up. So to maintain testosterone levels you need to strength train.</p><h1 id="Oysters"><a href="#Oysters" class="headerlink" title="Oysters"></a>Oysters</h1><p>Oysters contain more zinc per serving than any other food. Zinc is important for sperm health and reproductive function. Men with severe zinc deficiency may experience hypogonadism, which means that their bodies do not produce enough testosterone. They may also experience impotence or delayed sexual maturity.</p><h1 id="Green-Leafy-Vegetables"><a href="#Green-Leafy-Vegetables" class="headerlink" title="Green Leafy Vegetables"></a>Green Leafy Vegetables</h1><p>Dark green leafy vegetables are an excellent source of micronutrients, including magnesium, a mineral that is essential for maintaining optimal testosterone levels, especially in older men.</p><p>Magnesium is thought to increase the biological activity of testosterone in the body because it reduces oxidative stress. Oxidative stress is an imbalance between the body’s antioxidant defenses and free radicals. Oxidative stress and inflammation can reduce testosterone levels, so consuming nutrients that fight oxidative stress can help maintain healthy testosterone levels.</p><h1 id="Eggs"><a href="#Eggs" class="headerlink" title="Eggs"></a>Eggs</h1><p>Egg yolks are rich in healthy fats, protein and selenium, a mineral that acts as an antioxidant in the body. Eggs are an excellent source of protein, cholesterol, vitamin D and omega-3s, all of which contribute to testosterone production. Eggs are a very versatile ingredient, not only do they help boost testosterone levels, but the protein in them also helps build muscle.</p><h1 id="Fatty-fish-and-fish-oil"><a href="#Fatty-fish-and-fish-oil" class="headerlink" title="Fatty fish and fish oil"></a>Fatty fish and fish oil</h1><p>Fatty fish is very beneficial because it is rich in omega-3 fatty acids. You can also boost omega-3 fatty acid levels by taking fish oil or omega-3 supplements. Fish that are rich in omega-3 fatty acids include</p><ul><li>Mackerel</li><li>Herring</li><li>Salmon</li><li>Sardines</li><li>Trout</li></ul><h1 id="Garlic"><a href="#Garlic" class="headerlink" title="Garlic"></a>Garlic</h1><p>Garlic contains a compound called allicin, which can be used to lower cortisol levels. Cortisol is produced in the adrenal glands, which is where testosterone is produced. When your body is under stress, it produces cortisol, which can have an effect on other bodily functions, including testosterone production. Therefore, by reducing the amount of cortisol in your system, you allow the adrenal glands to produce testosterone more efficiently. Garlic itself does not increase testosterone, but it is a cortisol-reducing agent.</p><h1 id="Berries-cherries-and-pomegranates"><a href="#Berries-cherries-and-pomegranates" class="headerlink" title="Berries, cherries and pomegranates"></a>Berries, cherries and pomegranates</h1><p>Berries, cherries and pomegranates are rich in flavonoid antioxidants, which may help protect testosterone-producing cells from damage and increase testosterone production. Pomegranates, berries and cherries may prevent inflammation caused by obesity, which can lower testosterone levels.</p>]]></content>

Positive eating helps you to slow down your meals and eat less, yet enjoy your food more. Take a seat at the table and control the speed of your meal, taking at least 20 minutes or so. You can also try the following:[7]<br>Avoid distractions at mealtime, such as turning off the TV and putting down your mobile phone.<br>Look carefully at the appearance and smell of the food before eating.<br>Hold your utensils in your non-dominant hand or eat with a knife and fork that you are not good at using.<br>Chew your food slowly and taste each bite carefully.<br>Pictures with the title Eat Properly Step 6<br>6<br>Control emotional eating with the help of a therapist. Emotional eating is when a person seeks solace from food when he or she is sad, lonely or bored. This can lead to eating when you are not hungry, eating unhealthy foods, and overeating. Learning to cope with your emotions in other healthy ways can help you eat healthier. It is recommended to consult a therapist who is experienced in treating emotional eating. [8]<br>A therapist will teach you to identify your feelings and improve your mood in ways other than eating, such as walking, deep breathing or listening to music.<br>Ask your doctor to refer you to a therapist. Some insurance policies require a referral letter from a doctor to be covered.<br>Methods<br>2<br>Make healthy food and drink choices<br>Pictures under the heading Eat Properly Step 7<br>1<br>Make sure vegetables and fruit make up half of your meal. Fruits and vegetables are full of nutrients and fibre and are lower in calories than other foods, especially organic fruits and vegetables that are free from pesticides. Eating 1-2 servings of fruit or vegetables at each meal will help you feel fuller sooner and it will also keep you fuller for longer. [9]<br>Vegetables can be steamed, sautéed quickly, roasted or boiled, depending on your preference.<br>If you don’t want to cook your vegetables, you can serve them with a salad or raw vegetable slices.<br>If you’re in a hurry, choose fresh fruit that’s easy to eat on the move, such as apples or bananas, or a portion of cooked fruit.<br>Image captioned Eat Properly Step 8<br>2<br>Cut down on refined carbohydrates and eat whole grains instead. As well as being rich in carbohydrates, whole grains are also healthier for your body as they contain more fibre and nutrients. They also maintain satiety and make your energy last longer. Instead of white rice, white bread and white pasta, opt for wholemeal bread, wholemeal pasta and brown rice instead. Other healthy whole grains include:[10]<br>Quinoa<br>Barley<br>Rye bread<br>Oats<br>Images with the title Eat Properly Step 9<br>3<br>Include a serving of lean protein with each meal. Protein should make up a quarter of each meal. High protein foods include meat, fish, pulses and eggs. Some dairy products are also rich in protein, such as cottage cheese and whey-free yoghurt. Choose lean proteins such as skinless chicken breasts, tilapia, ground turkey, beans, tofu and egg whites to reduce fat and cholesterol in your diet for better overall health. [11]<br>Check the food packaging to find out the serving size. The exact serving size varies for each type of food. For example, a serving of meat or fish is 85g and a serving of pulses or cottage cheese is 120g.<br>Tip: Remove the fat or skin before eating, as this will reduce the fat content of the meat.</p><p>Image with Eat Properly Step 10 as the title<br>4<br>Reduce your intake of fats. A healthy percentage of fat should be 20-35%. For example, if you limit yourself to 2,000 calories a day, you should consume 44-77 grams of fat since each gram of fat contains roughly 9 calories. It is best to choose healthy fats, such as mono- and polyunsaturated fats; eat less or no unhealthy fats at all, like saturated and trans fats. Include 2-3 servings of olive oil, nuts, seeds or avocado in your daily diet to consume healthy fats. [12]<br>Do not consume more than 10% of your total daily calories from saturated fats. For example, if you limit yourself to 1,700 calories per day, no more than 170 calories should come from saturated fats. This means a maximum of 19 grams of saturated fat per day.<br>Check to see if trans fats are listed on food labels. If it does, then don’t buy or eat it. Trans fats are commonly found in margarine, shortening, coffee creamer and many pre-packaged convenience foods, such as packaged baked goods. [13]<br>Image captioned with Eat Properly Step 11<br>5<br>Drink more water and less or no sugary drinks at all. Plain water is enough to hydrate your body and you really don’t need to drink anything else. If you do want to drink other drinks, then limit your intake. Do not drink more than 240ml of fruit juice a day, sugary soft drinks and other drinks with natural or artificial sweeteners. [14]<br>Everyone needs to drink different amounts of water. Drink water when you feel thirsty. As long as your urine is light yellow and you don’t feel thirsty, you are well hydrated.<br>Drinking in moderation is fine. One alcoholic drink is defined as 350 ml of beer, 150 ml of wine or 45 ml of spirits. [15]<br>Image with Eat Properly Step 12 as title<br>6<br>Allow yourself the occasional unhealthy food and do not completely ban yourself from a particular food. Most of the time you must choose healthy foods, but occasionally you can indulge yourself. As long as you are eating healthy foods most of the time, it is okay to have the occasional doughnut, two slices of pizza or a high-calorie food such as a milkshake. Try to indulge yourself 1 or 2 times a week and plan ahead to avoid eating too much yourself. [16]<br>For example, you could plan to have pizza on Friday night or ice cream with the family on Sunday afternoon.<br>If you keep track of calories with an app or food diary, remember to take into account your extra calorie intake in advance. For example, if you know that 2 slices of pizza contain roughly 600 calories, you can eat less for lunch that day to offset the extra calories you consumed at dinner.<br>Method<br>3<br>Eat at the right time<br>Pictures with Eat Properly Step 13 as the title<br>1<br>Learn to recognise when your body really feels hungry. Paying careful attention to your body’s hunger signals can help prevent you from eating too much, or eating out of boredom. If you are not sure if you are hungry, take some time to think about when you ate your last meal and how much you ate. If it’s been more than 3 hours since your last meal, you’re probably hungry. If it’s been less than 3 hours, you may be craving something for another reason. [17]<br>Some people use the ‘HALT’ rule to stop themselves from eating mindlessly, which stands for Hungry, Angry, Lonely and Tired. If you want to eat but are not actually hungry, ask yourself if you feel any of these four emotions. If so, look for ways to cope with these emotions other than food.<br>For example, if you are feeling angry or anxious, it may be helpful to find out what the real cause is. If you feel lonely, call a friend and ask if they can meet up. If you feel tired, take a nap to replenish your energy. [18]<br>Pictures with the title Eat Properly Step 14<br>2<br>Eat regular meals during the day. This ensures that your body gets the energy it needs throughout the day. Eat breakfast soon after you get up, followed by a morning snack, lunch, an afternoon snack and dinner. [19]<br>Don’t skip any meals! This will make you eat more at the next meal and make up for the last one you missed.<br>Tip: Try to eat a hearty breakfast and eat less for the two meals and snacks that follow. This will help to maintain your energy throughout the day. [20]</p><p>Pictures with the title Eat Properly Step 15<br>3<br>Eat dinner a little earlier to give your digestive system time to rest. The body does not need energy when it is resting, such as at night when you are sleeping. Eating before bedtime can interfere with sleep and the body cannot digest food efficiently, which may be stored as excess fat in the body. Plan to stop eating at least 3 hours before bedtime to give your body a long rest period between dinner and breakfast. [21]<br>For example, if you go to bed at 9.30pm, then eat dinner at 6pm. Then don’t eat anything else until breakfast the next day.<br>Pictures with Eat Properly Step 16 as their title<br>4<br>Try intermittent fasting. Intermittent fasting is when you eat all 3 main meals and 2 snacks during the 8-10 hours when you are most active during the day. This limits the amount of time you can eat and gives your body more time to burn the calories you consume. You may find yourself eating less instead. Find the time frame that works best for you and schedule all 3 main meals and 2 snacks to be eaten within that time frame. [22]<br>As an example, you could eat each meal of the day between 8am and 4pm, e.g. breakfast at 8am, lunch at 12pm and dinner at 4pm.</p>]]></content>

      <title>Twelve questions about milk</title>
      <link href="/2022/06/27/health-121/"/>
      <url>/2022/06/27/health-121/</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p> As we all know, drinking milk is not only good for the growth and development of children and adolescents, but also for the bone health of adults. The first thing you want to do is simply drink a pure milk, but it is easy to be confused by the wide variety of milk on the market with different names, how to choose the right milk for you? Learn about the following 12 issues, buy milk will never be confused again.</p><a id="more"></a><p><img src="https://s2.loli.net/2022/06/27/wKYmJ5diF7vEtlW.png" alt="image.png"></p><ol><li>Buy milk, choose room temperature or low temperature?</li></ol><p>　　People who have time to buy milk regularly, have the conditions to refrigerate, and have high requirements for milk flavor: choose low temperature milk.</p><p>　　People who don’t have time to buy milk often, don’t have the conditions to refrigerate, and like to stock up during sales: choose room temperature milk.</p><p>　　Ambient milk (ultra-high temperature sterilized milk) is milk produced and processed using ultra-high temperature instantaneous sterilization technology and filled into aseptic packaging. Due to the relatively high sterilization temperature, although there is no loss of nutrients such as protein and calcium in the milk, there is loss of folic acid and B vitamins, and slight changes in the flavor of the milk. After high temperature sterilization, the sweet taste of milk will become lighter and more intense, some people feel the “strange taste”, while others prefer the “strong” flavor.</p><p>　　Ambient milk is usually packaged in aseptic laminated paper, which allows the milk to be kept at room temperature for a longer period of time without refrigeration or preservatives.</p><p>　　Low-temperature milk (also known as fresh milk) usually refers to pasteurized milk. Compared to room temperature milk, pasteurized milk is sterilized at a relatively low temperature, so it retains its flavor and texture and vitamins relatively well.</p><p>　　In addition, some heat-sensitive bioactive substances in milk, such as lactoferrin, are retained more. However, in terms of protein and calcium supplementation, there is little difference between room temperature milk and low temperature milk.</p><p>　　Low temperature milk has a short shelf life, usually 2-8 days, and needs to be refrigerated for those who usually shop and refrigerate their food conveniently. If conditions do not allow, just buy room temperature milk.</p><p>　　If drinking directly, low temperature milk provides a sweeter milk flavor.</p><p>　　If you use milk for cooking, baking or making coffee, strong-flavored room-temperature milk is more suitable.</p><p>　　2. Is pasteurized milk fresher and more nutritious?</p><p>　　Generally speaking, pasteurized milk is fresher. There is no difference in most nutrients, such as protein and calcium, in pasteurized milk compared to room temperature milk. However, overall, pasteurized milk has a relatively higher nutritional value.</p><p>　　Making pasteurized milk requires a low sterilization temperature and requires a higher base condition of the milk itself, so the best milk sources are generally used to make fresh pasteurized milk.</p><p>　　3. Is low-fat skim milk better than whole milk?</p><p>　　People who drink a lot of milk and need to lose strict weight can choose low-fat milk.</p><p>　　The Chinese Dietary Guidelines do not specifically recommend low-fat or skim milk. For the average person, it is not recommended to choose low-fat or skim milk. If the fat in milk is removed, more than 85% of the fat-soluble vitamins are lost. The vitamin A and vitamin D in milk are both vitamins that Chinese people are more likely to be deficient in. Also, milk fat is not all saturated fat; it also contains some beneficial fatty acids, such as conjugated linoleic acid.</p><p>　　People who are losing weight may struggle with whether they will gain weight by drinking milk, which mainly depends on the amount of milk intake. If you drink 300 grams of whole milk per day as recommended by the Chinese Dietary Guidelines, the fat intake through milk is 9.3 grams based on a fat content of 3.1%; if you switch to skim milk, you will consume about 1.5 grams of fat based on a fat content of 0.5%. Therefore, replacing whole milk with skim milk also reduces 7.8 grams of fat, which is less than 1 tablespoon of frying oil.</p><p>　　4. Is recovered milk watered down?</p><p>　　Recovery milk is simply milk made from milk powder and water - not milk to water, but milk powder to water.</p><p>　　China’s milk-producing regions are relatively small, the source of milk is relatively small, the price of raw milk is more expensive. Therefore, importing milk powder from abroad and then recovering it back into liquid milk is a more economical way. However, the flavor of this recovered milk is really much worse, so sugar and other things are often added to flavor it, the most typical is the “Wan Chai milk” that many people loved to drink as children.</p><p>　　5. What kind of “milk” is blended with water?</p><p>　　If the package is marked with the words “dairy drink”, it is milk that has been watered down. Therefore, when buying related products, be sure to read the instructions on the packaging carefully.</p><p>　　6. Is student milk the best for children?</p><p>　　As a milk exclusively for school children, student milk is not sold in shopping malls. The basic principles of China’s Student Milk Program are safety, nutrition, convenience, and affordability. Therefore, you can usually give your children pure milk that you can buy in the market.</p><p>　　7. What is zero lactose milk?</p><p>　　Zero lactose milk is milk that has had the lactose in the milk removed and is suitable for people who are lactose intolerant. Many people are familiar with “lactose intolerance”, which is a condition that causes gas, burping and even bloating and diarrhea in people who are lactose intolerant.</p><p>　　The lactose content in milk is about 4.5%, and modern processes have been able to reduce or remove lactose from milk, with lactose content ≤ 2% in low lactose milk and ≤ 0.5% in lactose free milk. In this way, people with lactose intolerance can also drink milk.</p><p>　　It should be noted that the lactose in milk does not disappear out of thin air, but one molecule of lactose is degraded to produce two molecules of monosaccharides. Therefore, diabetics need to be reminded that zero lactose milk has a higher glycemic index and is not suitable for diabetics.</p><p>　　8. Is high-calcium milk better for calcium?</p><p>　　First of all, it depends on whether you are very calcium deficient; secondly, it depends on what kind of calcium is added to the high-calcium milk.</p><p>　　Milk is already rich in calcium, with about 100 mg of calcium per 100 g of milk. High-calcium milk should contain at least 120 mg of calcium per 100 grams of milk, which is actually not much higher.</p><p>　　The absorption rate of naturally occurring lactic calcium in milk is very high, but some companies add calcium carbonate to “high calcium milk” in order to save costs, and the absorption rate of this calcium is relatively low. If you want to buy high-calcium milk, you can choose products that add lactic calcium.</p><p>　　9. What is extra thick milk?</p><p>　　Generally speaking, extra concentrated milk is milk that is concentrated. This milk has a higher protein content and a creamier taste, but be aware that the fat content is also higher. However, some manufacturers are kind enough to remove some of the fat from extra concentrated milk, so pay attention to the nutrition label when you buy it.</p><p>　　10. What is A2 milk?</p><p>　　Milk that contains only A2 type beta-casein and not A1 type beta-casein is A2 beta-casein milk, or A2 milk for short. There are no studies that have found this type of milk to be more nutritious, but it tends to be more expensive.</p><p>　　Some studies have proven that A2 type proteins are more easily digested and absorbed by the body and do not cause symptoms of indigestion. If you have uncomfortable symptoms such as bloating and diarrhea as soon as you drink milk, and you still don’t get better with lactose-free milk, you can try A2 beta-casein milk. If you don’t have any discomfort from drinking milk, you can drink regular milk.</p><p>　　11. Is organic milk worth buying?</p><p>　　Organic milk is milk that is produced according to organic standards. Organic milk is safer, but the nutritional content is not higher than regular milk.</p><p>　　Please note that organic milk is much more expensive than regular milk, so please choose according to your financial situation.</p><p>　　12. Is the higher the protein, the better the milk?</p><p>　　Be careful! Milk is more than 90% water, so you can’t expect to drink milk to get more protein. Ordinary milk contains 3 grams of protein per 100 grams, even if some high protein milk can reach 5 grams of protein per 100 grams of milk, according to the Chinese Nutrition Society recommends drinking 300 grams of milk per day, so only 6 grams more protein intake than ordinary milk, it is better to eat more bites of meat.</p><p>　　However, if the high protein milk is native, not concentrated out of high protein, it does indicate that the milk source is good, still please choose it according to your own economic situation.</p>]]></content>

      <title>Difference between asymptomatic infected patients and confirmed cases of pneumonia</title>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Difference between asymptomatic infected patients and confirmed cases of pneumonia</p><a id="more"></a><p>　An asymptomatic infected person and a confirmed case are very different. An asymptomatic infected person is one in which the pathogen has invaded the organism so that the organism can detect the pathogen. However, the organism is not damaged by the pathogen, nor does it show any clinical discomfort or clinical symptoms, and even some laboratory tests are negative. A confirmed case is actually a clinical case, since it is a clinical case, the patient is sick, sick with some clinical discomfort, clinical symptoms and manifestations, for example, a confirmed case of a new coronavirus patient, that is, he has got a new coronavirus infection infectious disease, even it can appear pneumonia, can appear systemic fever It can even develop pneumonia, systemic fever, and some damage to various organs. Therefore, there is a difference between asymptomatic and confirmed cases.</p><p>　　However, some asymptomatic infections are not really asymptomatic, they are just incubation periods before the disease arrives. So, it will turn into a confirmed case. So, this kind of asymptomatic infected person has to be distinguished whether it is truly asymptomatic or whether he is a true case in the latent period before he gets the disease.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>What are the initial symptoms of hpv in women</p><a id="more"></a><p>HPV infection in women is usually asymptomatic, but I can tell you from my years of experience that there are still some signs of infection. For example, many women have itchy vulva problems, but there are no signs of mold or trichomonas infection on multiple tests, so you should check for HPV infection.</p><p>　　Secondly, because HPV infection may be related to sexual life. Many people will have acute or chronic cervicitis, when this state appears there will be abnormalities in the leucorrhea, pain in the lower abdomen, even involving the pelvic inflammatory reaction, many people will have pain in the abdomen on both sides, involving some adnexal problems. Even severe cases can affect the bladder and nighttime urination can increase, which may indicate inflammation of the cervix, but this is not an absolute symptom of HPV infection.</p><p>　　There is also the problem that many women have a combined state of HPV infection, causing contact bleeding when they come into sexual contact.</p><p>　　It is true that contact bleeding is not a direct symptom of HPV infection, but we know from past experience that when contact bleeding occurs, in addition to inflammation, we must consider whether there is cervical lesion or even cervical cancer, but in most cases, we believe that HP V infection is asymptomatic.</p><p>　　Therefore, I remind the general public, especially women, when you have sex, you should regularly check whether there is HP V infection, in order to cervical cancer screening, have sex with HPV regular examination, to find out whether he has infection, or even whether there are lesions, so although HPV infection does not have any specific symptoms that are considered common, but when the above-mentioned problems occur, it should still prompt you to check more often.</p>]]></content>

      <title>Unexplained acute hepatitis in children is &quot;suspicious&quot;</title>
      <link href="/2022/05/16/health-18/"/>
      <url>/2022/05/16/health-18/</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently, there has been a trend of concentrated episodes of previously disseminated acute hepatitis in children of unknown origin. Acute hepatitis in children reported in several countries was initially identified in countries such as Europe and the United States, and later appeared in several countries in Asia and other countries. This has caused a high degree of alarm among relevant researchers in China.</p><a id="more"></a><p>“Acute hepatitis of unknown origin is very damaging to the liver function of children.” Ning Qin, director of the Department of Infection at the National Medical Center for Major Public Health Events and Tongji Hospital of the Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology (hereinafter referred to as Tongji Hospital), told Science and Technology Daily on May 13 that, in addition to the great harm, another important reason for the incident to cause concern is that it occurred centrally in a short period of time. In the past, this kind of unexplained hepatitis in children was disseminated and the number of cases was small, but this time the number of reported cases in a short period of time is high, which has the potential to cause infection.</p><p>　　But what is puzzling is that if it is an infectious disease, there is no spatial or temporal intersection between children in different countries or regions, so theoretically there can be no mutual transmission, and how is it concentrated over a period of time?</p><p>　　Doubtful”, many causes of disease “can not be matched”</p><p>　　As of May 3, about 228 cases of acute hepatitis in children of unknown origin had been reported in 20 countries and territories worldwide, including at least 20 cases of liver transplantation, accounting for about 8.8 percent of cases, and four deaths.</p><p>　　“The affected children have common characteristics, such as the presence of jaundice and elevated transaminase indicators.” Professor Luo Xiaoping, director of the Department of Pediatrics at Tongji Hospital, said that when such cases are encountered, hospitals follow the routine process of screening for viral hepatitis, non-hepatophilic viral infections, autoimmune hepatitis, metabolic liver disease and drug-related infections, and determine the cause based on the results.</p><p>　　The World Health Organization investigated cases of acute hepatitis of unknown origin and ruled out hepatitis A, B, C, D, E, and other hepatitis virus infections, so what exactly is the cause?</p><p>　　Some scholars speculated that it might be T-cell-based autoimmune hepatitis triggered by vaccination with the New Crown mRNA vaccine. However, further investigation revealed that most of the affected children were not vaccinated with the New Crown mRNA vaccine, and this possibility was ruled out.</p><p>　　Molecular biology tests revealed the presence of a human adenovirus (HAdV) type 41 in some of the patients’ serum samples, and it is now the biggest “suspect”. But the problem is that, according to past experience, human adenovirus is not that destructive.</p><p>　　“People have studied human adenovirus more deeply, from the molecular structure to pathogenicity, to different tissue orientation, different toxicity are better understood.” Ning Qin said that human adenovirus mostly invades the respiratory tract, a few trigger gastroenteritis, conjunctivitis, resulting in liver failure is even more rare cases.</p><p>　　Infection with a new variant of the new coronavirus is one of the possible causes</p><p>　　Currently, the industry believes that in addition to human adenovirus infection, there are other possibilities, such as a new hepatophilic virus that has not yet been identified, a new variant of human adenovirus, drugs, toxins or environmental exposure, and other factors …… There is also analysis that infection with a new variant strain of the new coronavirus is also considered one of the possibilities.</p><p>　　“Although some cases have tested positive for new coronavirus and/or human adenovirus, genetic identification of the virus is needed to determine the association between the two.” Ningqin said further in-depth research is needed to determine whether it is a novel virus.</p><p>　　In addition, it may be that the virus is more pathogenic due to increased susceptibility in young children during the new coronary pneumonia epidemic and should be tested on blood, serum, urine, stool and respiratory samples and even liver biopsy samples from affected children.</p><p>　　“In fact, it is inconclusive whether the unexplained childhood hepatitis occurring in various countries is caused by the same etiology.” Ning Qin said there is no evidence that the cases occurring in different places are caused by the same cause, so international exchanges and cooperation should be strengthened, such as achieving the sharing of gene sequencing results in the international academic community, in order to solve the mystery earlier.</p>]]></content>

      <title>14.9 million excess deaths due to COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021</title>
      <link href="/2022/05/15/health-17/"/>
      <url>/2022/05/15/health-17/</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>14.9 million excess deaths due to COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021</p><a id="more"></a><p><img src="https://s2.loli.net/2022/05/15/hfEZxJUartjbIs5.png" alt="image.png"></p><p>New estimates from the World Health Organization (WHO) put the total number of deaths directly or indirectly associated with the COVID-19 pandemic (known as “excess deaths”) at approximately 14.9 million (range 13.3 million to 16.6 million) between January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2021.</p><p>These sobering figures show not only the impact of the pandemic, but also the need for all countries to invest in more resilient health systems to be able to sustain essential health services during a crisis, including stronger health information systems,” said WHO Director-General Dr. Tandusse. WHO is committed to working with all countries to strengthen their health information systems to produce better data for improved decision-making and outcomes.”</p><p>Excess deaths are calculated as the difference between the number of deaths that have occurred and the number of deaths that would have been expected in the absence of a pandemic, based on data from previous years.</p><p>The excess number of deaths includes deaths directly (due to disease) or indirectly (due to the impact of the pandemic on the health system and society) associated with COVID-19. Deaths indirectly related to COVID-19 can be attributed to other health conditions where people are unable to access appropriate prevention and treatment due to an overwhelmed health system as a result of the pandemic. Some deaths were averted during the pandemic due to the reduced risk of certain events (e.g., motor vehicle accidents or occupational injuries), which could also affect the estimated number of excess deaths.</p><p>Most excess deaths (84%) were concentrated in Southeast Asia, Europe, and the Americas. Approximately 68% of excess deaths globally were concentrated in just 10 countries. Of the 14.9 million excess deaths over 24 months, middle-income countries accounted for 81% (53% in lower-middle-income countries and 28% in upper-middle-income countries), while high-income and low-income countries accounted for 15% and 4%, respectively.</p><p>These estimates, which cover 24 months (2020 and 2021), include excess deaths by age and sex. These estimates confirm that there are more deaths among men than women globally (57% for men and 43% for women) and that the number of deaths is higher among the elderly. The absolute number of excess deaths is influenced by the size of the population. The number of excess deaths per 100,000 people provides a more objective picture of the pandemic than the reported COVID-19 mortality data.</p><p>Measuring excess mortality is an essential element in understanding the impact of a pandemic,” said Dr. Samira Asma, assistant director-general of WHO’s Data, Analysis and Action Department. Changes in mortality trends can provide decision makers with information to guide policies related to mortality reduction and effective prevention of future crises. The true extent of excess mortality is often obscured by the limited investment in data systems in many countries. These new estimates use the best available data and are generated in a methodologically sound and fully transparent manner.”</p><p>Dr. Ibrahima Socé Fall, Assistant Director General for Critical Incident Response, said, “Data is the foundation of our work every day to improve health, keep the world safe and serve vulnerable populations. We know where the data gaps are, and together we must strengthen our support to countries so that each has the ability to track outbreaks in real time, ensure the delivery of essential health services, and safeguard population health.”</p><p>The estimates are the product of a global collaboration supported by the work of the COVID-19 Mortality Assessment Technical Advisory Group and national consultation efforts.</p><p>The COVID-19 Mortality Assessment Technical Advisory Group, jointly convened by WHO and the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UN DESA), consists of many of the world’s leading experts who have developed an innovative approach to generating comparable mortality estimates even when data are incomplete or unavailable.</p><p>This approach is invaluable because many countries still lack reliable mortality surveillance capacity and therefore cannot collect and generate the data needed to calculate excess deaths. With this publicly available method, countries can use their own data to generate or update their own estimates.</p><p>The UN system is making a concerted effort to produce an authoritative assessment of the global death toll from the pandemic,” said Mr. Liu Zhenmin, UN Under-Secretary-General for Economic and Social Affairs. This work is an important part of the ongoing collaboration between UN DESA and WHO and other partners to improve global mortality estimates.”</p><p>Mr. Stefan Schweinfest, Director of the UN DESA Statistics Division, added, “Data gaps make it difficult to assess the true scope of the crisis, with serious consequences for people’s lives. The pandemic is a clear reminder of the need for better coordination of data systems within countries and increased international support to build better systems, including registration systems for deaths and other vital events.”</p>]]></content>

      <title>COVID-19 vaccine and immunization: what is vaccination?</title>
      <link href="/2022/05/15/health-16/"/>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>COVID-19 vaccine and immunization: what is vaccination?</p><a id="more"></a><h1 id="What-is-vaccination"><a href="#What-is-vaccination" class="headerlink" title="What is vaccination?"></a>What is vaccination?</h1><p>Vaccination is a simple, safe and effective way to protect you from harmful diseases before you are exposed to them. Vaccinations use your body’s natural defense mechanisms to build resistance to specific infections and to boost your immune system. </p><p>Vaccines train your immune system to produce antibodies, just like exposure to a disease. However, because vaccines contain only inactivated or attenuated forms of viruses or bacteria, they do not cause disease or put you at risk for complications. </p><p>Most vaccines are given by injection, but some are given orally or sprayed into the nose.</p><h1 id="How-do-vaccines-work"><a href="#How-do-vaccines-work" class="headerlink" title="How do vaccines work?"></a>How do vaccines work?</h1><p>Vaccines reduce the risk of disease by working with your body’s natural defenses to build protection. When vaccinated, your immune system responds by being able to.</p><p>Recognize an invading virus or bacteria.<br>Produce antibodies, proteins that the immune system naturally produces to fight disease.<br>Remember about the disease and how to fight it. If you are exposed to the same germ in the future, your immune system will quickly destroy it before you get sick.<br>Therefore, vaccines are a safe and smart way to cause an immune response in the body without causing disease. </p><p>Our immune system has a memory function. Once exposed to one or more doses of a vaccine, we usually maintain our resistance to disease for years, decades, or even a lifetime. This is what makes vaccines so effective. Vaccines are not meant to treat us after we get sick, but to prevent us from getting sick in advance.</p><h1 id="Why-is-it-important-to-get-vaccinated"><a href="#Why-is-it-important-to-get-vaccinated" class="headerlink" title="Why is it important to get vaccinated?"></a>Why is it important to get vaccinated?</h1><p>Without vaccines, we are at risk for serious illness and disability from diseases such as measles, meningitis, pneumonia, tetanus and polio. Many of these diseases can be life-threatening. The WHO estimates that childhood vaccines alone could save more than 4 million lives each year. </p><p>Although some diseases may have become uncommon, their causative agents continue to spread in some or all parts of the world. In today’s world, infectious diseases can easily cross borders and infect any unprotected person. </p><p>The two main reasons to get vaccinated are to protect ourselves and those around us. However, not everyone can be vaccinated; for example, young infants, people with serious illnesses or certain allergies cannot be vaccinated and must rely on others to be vaccinated to ensure they do not contract vaccine-preventable diseases.</p><h1 id="Are-the-vaccines-safe"><a href="#Are-the-vaccines-safe" class="headerlink" title="Are the vaccines safe?"></a>Are the vaccines safe?</h1><p>Vaccinations are safe, and side effects of the vaccine are usually small and temporary, such as arm pain or a mild fever. More serious side effects are possible, but are extremely rare. </p><p>Any licensed vaccine undergoes multiple phases of rigorous testing before it is approved for use and is periodically re-evaluated after adoption. Scientists are also constantly monitoring information from multiple sources, looking for any signs that vaccines may be causing health risks. </p><p>Keep in mind that vaccine-preventable diseases are far more likely to cause serious harm than vaccines. For example, tetanus can cause extreme pain, muscle spasms (jaw cramps) and blood clots, and measles can cause encephalitis (a brain infection) and blindness. Many vaccine-preventable diseases can even lead to death. The benefits of vaccination far outweigh the risks, and without it, more illnesses and deaths would occur.</p><h1 id="Are-there-any-side-effects-of-the-COVID-19-vaccine"><a href="#Are-there-any-side-effects-of-the-COVID-19-vaccine" class="headerlink" title="Are there any side effects of the COVID-19 vaccine?"></a>Are there any side effects of the COVID-19 vaccine?</h1><p> Like any medication, the vaccine can cause mild side effects such as a low-grade fever, pain at the injection site, or redness. Mild reactions will go away on their own within a few days. </p><p>Severe or lasting side effects are extremely rare. The safety of the vaccine should be monitored continuously to detect rare adverse events.</p>]]></content>

Safe greetings include waving, nodding or bowing.</p><p>Q: Should I avoid shaking hands due to the new coronavirus?<br>A: Yes. Shaking hands, touching eyes, nose and mouth can spread respiratory viruses. You can wave, nod or bow when greeting someone.</p><p>Q: Will wearing rubber gloves in public be effective in preventing neocoronavirus infection?<br>A: No. Washing your hands often is more effective in preventing COVID-19 infection than wearing rubber gloves, which may be contaminated with COVID-19 contaminants. If you subsequently touch your face, the contaminant can be transferred from the gloves to your face and may transmit the disease to you.</p><p>Q: What can I do to shop safely during a COVID-19 outbreak?<br>A: When shopping, stay at least 1 meter away from others and avoid touching your eyes, mouth and nose. If possible, disinfect the handrails or handles of shopping carts or baskets before shopping. Wash your hands thoroughly when you get home and also after handling and storing your purchases.</p><p>Q: How do I wash my fruits and vegetables during the COVID-19 outbreak?<br>A: Fruits and vegetables are an important part of a healthy diet. They can be washed in the same way as any other situation. Before handling, wash your hands with soap and water. Then, wash fruits and vegetables thoroughly with clean water, especially if they are eaten raw</p><p>Q: Can COVID-19 be transmitted through coins and banknotes?<br>A: There is no evidence to confirm or deny that COVID-19 virus can be transmitted through coins or banknotes. However, respiratory droplets expelled by an infected person can contaminate and remain on the surface of objects. Wash your hands regularly and thoroughly after touching surfaces or objects that are frequently touched by people, including coins or banknotes. If your hands are not cleaned, avoid touching your eyes, mouth and nose.</p><p>Q: How should I wash and dry my clothes, towels and bedding if I have a suspected or confirmed patient with COVID-19 in my home?<br>Wash the patient’s clothes, towels, and bedding separately.<br>If possible, wear firm gloves before handling.<br>Never hold these soiled supplies close to the body; they should be placed in a clearly marked, non-leaking container (e.g., bag or bucket).<br>Use a flat, sturdy utensil to scrape solid excrement (such as feces or vomit) from these supplies into the patient’s toilet bowl before placing them in a dedicated container. If the patient’s room does not have a toilet fixture, the scraped excrement needs to be placed in a bucket with a lid and then taken to the toilet for disposal.<br>Wash and disinfect these items: Use a washing machine with hot water (60-90°C) and detergent. They can also be soaked in hot soapy water in a large bucket and then agitated with a stick, but care should be taken not to slap and splash them. If hot water is not available, they can be immersed in 0.05% chlorine bleach for about 30 minutes. Finally, they need to be rinsed with water and then hung out in the sun to dry.<br>Don’t forget to wash your hands at the end.<br>Q: How should I wash and dry my clothes, towels and bedding if there is no suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patient in my home?<br>A: They should be washed as usual with detergent or soap. It is not necessary to use a washing machine or dryer or to use very hot water. After drying clothes, be sure to wash your hands before handling and storing clothes, towels, and bedding.</p><p>If you have a suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patient in your home, wash their clothes, towels and bedding separately. Contaminated materials should always be kept away from your skin or clothing.</p>]]></content>

Adapting to such lifestyle changes and managing the fear of contracting a virus and worrying about those who are particularly vulnerable around us is a challenge for all of us. This can be particularly difficult for people with mental health conditions.</p><p>Fortunately, there is much we can do to take care of our own mental health and to help those who may need extra support and care.</p><p>Here are some suggestions to help you.</p><p>Stay informed. Listen to national and local authorities for advice and recommendations. Follow trusted news channels, such as local and national TV and radio stations, and keep up to date with information from WHO on social media.<br>Establish a routine. Keep a daily routine or create a new one whenever possible.<br>Wake up and go to bed at the same time every day.<br>Maintain personal hygiene.<br>Eat healthy foods regularly.<br>Exercise regularly.<br>Delineate a time for work and rest.<br>Make time for the things you enjoy.<br>Reduce your news supply. Try to reduce the number of times you watch, read or listen to news that makes you feel anxious or distressed. If necessary, seek out the latest information only once or twice at specific times of the day.<br>Social contact is important. If movement is limited, stay in regular contact with friends and family via phone and online channels.<br>Alcohol and drug use. Limit the amount of alcohol you drink, or don’t drink at all. Don’t start drinking if you haven’t done so before. Avoid using alcohol and drugs as a way to cope with fear, anxiety, boredom, and social isolation.<br>There is no evidence that drinking alcohol has any protective effect against viruses or other infections. In fact, quite the contrary, harmful use of alcohol can increase the risk of infection and lead to worse treatment outcomes.</p><p>And be aware that alcohol and drug use may lead to an inability to take adequate precautions to protect yourself against infection, such as observing hand hygiene.</p><p>Screen time. Be aware of the amount of time you spend in front of a screen each day. Make sure you take regular breaks during screen use.<br>Video games. While video games can be used as a way to relax, you can’t help but spend more time on them when you stay at home for long periods of time. Be sure to maintain the right balance in your daily life.<br>Social media. Use social media accounts to promote positive and hopeful stories. Correct misinformation whenever and wherever you can.<br>Help others. If you are able, provide support to people in your community who may need help, such as helping them buy food.<br>Support health workers. Take the opportunity to thank your country’s health care workers and all those who are working to respond to the COVID-19 outbreak, either online or through your community.<br>Don’t discriminate<br>Fear is a normal reaction when faced with uncertainty. However, sometimes fear is expressed in ways that can hurt others. Remember.</p><p>Be kind. Don’t discriminate against others because you are afraid of COVID-19 transmission.<br>Don’t discriminate against people who you think may be carrying the coronavirus.<br>Don’t discriminate against health workers. Health workers deserve our respect and gratitude.<br>COVID-19 has affected people in many countries, do not attribute it to any particular group.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>During the covid-19 outbreak Staying healthy while at home: physical activity</p><a id="more"></a><p>The COVID-19 pandemic means that many of us are staying at home and sitting still more than ever. It’s hard for many people to get as much exercise as they normally would. It’s even harder for people who aren’t usually physically active to exercise. </p><p>However, at times like these, it is important for people of all ages and abilities to stay as active as possible. The WHO’s “Stay Active” campaign is designed to help you do just that, while having some fun. </p><p>Remember: taking a break from sitting and doing 3-4 minutes of low-intensity physical activity, such as walking or stretching, will help to soothe your muscles and improve circulation and muscle activity. </p><p>Regular physical activity is good for your physical and mental health, can lower high blood pressure, help control weight and reduce the risk of heart disease, stroke, type II diabetes and various cancers - all of which increase susceptibility to COVID-19. </p><p>Regular physical activity also builds bone and muscle strength, and improves balance, flexibility and fitness. In older adults, activities that improve balance can help prevent falls and injuries. </p><p>Regular physical activity helps to have a daily routine and serves as a way to stay connected with family and friends. It also benefits our mental health - reducing the risk of developing depression and cognitive decline and delaying the onset of dementia, while improving overall well-being.</p><p>What is the recommended level of physical activity for each age group?<br>WHO has recommendations for how physically active people should be at all ages to benefit their health and well-being. </p><p>Infants under 1 year </p><ul><li><p>All infants should be physically active several times a day. </p></li><li><p>For those infants who are not yet physically mobile, be in a prone position for at least 30 minutes per day (prone time), as floor play can be done anytime throughout the day when the infant is awake. </p></li></ul><p>Children under 5 years of age </p><ul><li><p>All children should do at least 180 minutes of all types of physical activity of any intensity each day. </p></li><li><p>Children 3-4 years of age should do at least 60 minutes of moderate to vigorous intensity physical activity during this time.</p></li></ul><p>Children and adolescents 5-17 years of age </p><ul><li><p>All children and adolescents should do at least 60 minutes of moderate to vigorous intensity physical activity each day. </p></li><li><p>This includes activities that build muscle and bone strength at least 3 days per week. </p></li><li><p>Doing more than 60 minutes of physical activity per day will provide additional health benefits. </p></li></ul><p>Adults over 18 years of age </p><ul><li><p>All adults should do at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity in a week or at least 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity physical activity in a week. </p></li><li><p>For additional health benefits, adults should increase their moderate-intensity physical activity to 300 minutes per week or equivalent. </p></li><li><p>To improve and maintain musculoskeletal health, muscle-strengthening activities involving major muscle groups should be done 2 or more days per week. </p></li><li><p>In addition, older adults with limited mobility should do physical activity to enhance balance and prevent falls 3 or more days per week.</p></li></ul>]]></content>

      <title>A healthy diet helps prevent all types of malnutrition as well as non-communicable diseases including diabetes, heart disease, stroke and cancer.</title>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A healthy diet helps prevent all types of malnutrition as well as non-communicable diseases including diabetes, heart disease, stroke and cancer.</p><a id="more"></a><p><img src="https://s2.loli.net/2022/05/09/AP43E25uZWCnUMp.png" alt="image.png"></p><p>Important Facts<br>A healthy diet helps prevent all types of malnutrition as well as non-communicable diseases including diabetes, heart disease, stroke and cancer.<br>Unhealthy diets and lack of physical activity are major global health risks.<br>Healthy eating habits should be adopted early in life - breastfeeding promotes healthy growth and improves cognitive development, and may also have long-lasting health benefits, such as reduced risk of excess weight or obesity later in life, and the development of non-communicable diseases.<br>Energy (calorie) intake and expenditure should be balanced. To avoid excess weight, total fat intake should not exceed 30% of total energy (1, 2, 3). Saturated fat intake should be less than 10% of total energy and trans fat intake should not exceed 1% of total energy, and there should be a shift in fat intake from saturated and trans fats to unsaturated fats (3), and the goal is to eliminate industrially produced trans fats (4, 5, 6).<br>In a healthy diet, free sugar intake needs to be limited to less than 10% of total energy intake (2, 7). For additional health benefits, it is recommended to further reduce the intake of free sugars to less than 5% of total energy intake (7).<br>Limiting salt intake to less than 5 g per day (equivalent to a daily sodium intake of no more than 2 g) would help prevent hypertension and reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke in adults (8).<br>WHO Member States agreed to reduce salt intake by 30% of the global population by 2025; they also agreed to halt the rising trend of diabetes and obesity in adults and adolescents and excess weight in childhood by 2025 (9, 10).</p><p>Overview<br>Maintaining a healthy diet throughout the life course can help prevent various types of malnutrition and a range of non-communicable diseases and conditions. However, with the increasing amount of processed foods, rapid urbanization, and evolving lifestyles, people’s eating patterns have changed. People now consume more foods rich in energy, fat, free sugars, and salt/sodium, and many do not consume enough fruits, vegetables, and other dietary fiber (e.g., whole grains).</p><p>The exact composition of a diverse, balanced, and healthy diet varies with individual circumstances (e.g., age, gender, lifestyle, and physical activity level), cultural background, locally available foods, and dietary practices. However, the basic principles that make up a healthy diet remain the same.</p><p>Adults<br>A healthy diet includes the following foods.</p><p>Fruits, vegetables, legumes (e.g., hamachi beans and pods, etc.), nuts, and whole legumes (e.g., unprocessed corn, millet, oats, barley, brown rice).<br>Consume at least 400 g (i.e., 5 types) of fruits and vegetables per day (2), excluding potatoes, sweet potatoes, cassava, and other starchy root foods.<br>Less than 10% of the total energy intake comes from free sugars (2, 7), which is equivalent to 50 g (or about 12 teaspoons) for an individual consuming about 2000 calories per day and of normal weight. Ideally, however, it should be less than 5% of total energy intake to obtain additional health benefits (7). Free sugars are all sugars added to foods or beverages by manufacturers, chefs or consumers, as well as those naturally occurring in honey, syrups, juices and concentrates.<br>Fat intake accounts for less than 30% of total energy (1, 2, 3). Unsaturated fats (from fish, avocados, nuts, sunflower oil, soy, canola and olive oils, etc.) are preferred over saturated fats (from fatty meats, butter, palm and coconut oils, cream, cheese, ghee and lard, etc.) and all types of trans fats, including industrially produced trans fats (from baked and fried foods, pre-packaged snacks and foods such as frozen pizza, pies, cookies, crackers, pancakes cookies, crackers, pancakes, cooking oils and spreads for food products) and mammalian trans fats (found in mammalian meat and dairy products such as cattle, sheep, goats, camels, etc.). It is recommended to reduce the intake of saturated fats to less than 10% of total energy intake and trans fats to less than 1% of total energy intake (5). In particular, industrially produced trans fats are not part of a healthy diet and should be avoided (4, 6).<br>Salt intake should be less than 5 g per day (equivalent to about one teaspoon) (8). Table salt should be iodized.<br>Infants and young children<br>Proper nutrition during the first 2 years of a child’s life promotes healthy growth and improves cognitive development, and also reduces the risk of excess weight or obesity and the development of noncommunicable diseases later in life.</p><p>Recommendations for a healthy diet for infants and children are similar to those for adults, but the following factors are also important.</p><p>Infants should be exclusively breastfed for the first six months of life.<br>Infants should be breastfed continuously until 2 years of age or beyond.<br>After 6 months of age, breastfeeding should be accompanied by the addition of an appropriate variety of nutritionally adequate, safe and thick foods. Salt and sugar should not be added to complementary foods.<br>Practical suggestions for maintaining a healthy diet<br>Fruits and vegetables<br>Consuming at least 400 g or five servings of fruits and vegetables daily will reduce the risk of NCDs (2) and help ensure adequate daily intake of dietary fiber.</p><p>Methods that can be used to increase fruit and vegetable intake include</p><p>Dishes are always accompanied by vegetables.<br>consuming fresh fruits and raw vegetables as a snack.<br>Consuming fresh fruits and vegetables in season.<br>Eating a variety of fruits and vegetables.<br>Fats<br>Adults who reduce their total fat intake to less than 30% of total energy will help prevent excess weight (1, 2, 3). The risk of developing NCDs can also be reduced by</p><p>Reducing saturated fat intake to less than 10% of total energy.<br>Reducing trans fats to less than 1% of total energy intake.<br>Replacing saturated and trans fats with unsaturated fats (2, 3), and especially by replacing them with polyunsaturated fats.<br>Fat intake, especially saturated fats and industrially produced trans fats, can be reduced by</p><p>Cooking by steaming or boiling, rather than frying.<br>Replacing cream, lard and ghee with oils rich in polyunsaturated fats such as soybean, canola, corn, safflower and sunflower oils.<br>consuming reduced-fat dairy products and lean meats, or removing overly fatty meats.<br>Limiting consumption of baked or fried foods, and prepackaged snacks and foods containing industrially produced trans fats (e.g., donuts, cakes, pies, cookies, crackers, and pancakes).<br>Salt, sodium and potassium<br>Most people consume too much sodium through salt (equivalent to an average daily intake of 9-12 grams of salt) and not enough potassium (less than 3.5 grams). Excessive sodium intake and insufficient potassium intake can lead to hypertension, which in turn increases the risk of heart disease and stroke (8, 11).</p><p>Reducing salt intake to less than the recommended 5 grams per day could prevent 1.7 million deaths per year (12).</p><p>People are often unaware of the amount of salt they consume. In many countries, salt mostly comes from processed foods (e.g. ready-to-eat foods, processed meats such as bacon, ham, sausages, cheese, salty snacks, etc.) or foods that are usually consumed in large quantities (e.g. bread). People also add salt to food during cooking (e.g., broths, solid soups, soy sauce, and fish sauce) or during consumption (e.g., refined salt).</p><p>Methods that can be used to reduce salt intake include</p><p>limiting the amount of salt and high-sodium seasonings (e.g., soy sauce, fish sauce, and broth) used in cooking and processing foods<br>not serving salt or other high-sodium condiments at the dinner table.<br>Limiting the consumption of salty snacks.<br>Choosing products that are lower in sodium.<br>Some food manufacturers are adjusting their recipes to reduce the sodium content of their products. People should be encouraged to check nutrition labels to know the sodium content of products before buying or eating them.</p><p>Potassium can reduce the adverse effects of high sodium intake on blood pressure. Consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables may increase potassium intake.</p><p>Sugar<br>For both adults and children, free sugar intake should be reduced to less than 10% of total energy intake (2, 7). Reducing to less than 5% of total energy intake will provide additional health benefits (7).</p><p>Consumption of free sugars can increase the risk of dental caries (tooth decay). Excess caloric intake from foods and beverages containing high levels of free sugars can also lead to inappropriate weight gain, which may lead to overweight and obesity. Recent evidence also suggests that free sugars have an impact on blood pressure and blood lipids and suggests that reducing free sugar intake may reduce risk factors for cardiovascular disease (13).</p><p> Methods that can be used to reduce sugar intake include</p><p>limiting consumption of foods and beverages with high sugar content, such as sugary snacks, candy, and sugary beverages (i.e., all types of beverages containing free sugars - including carbonated or non-carbonated soft drinks, fruit or vegetable juices and beverages, liquid and powdered concentrates, flavored water, energy and sports drinks, ready-to-drink tea, ready-to-drink coffee, and flavored dairy drinks)<br>Consume fresh fruits and raw vegetables as snacks rather than sugary snacks.<br>How to promote healthy eating<br>Diets change over time and are influenced by multiple social and economic factors. These factors interact in very complex ways to shape individual dietary patterns. These factors include income, food prices (which affect the availability and affordability of healthy foods), personal preferences and beliefs, cultural traditions, and geographic and environmental factors (including climate change). Thus, promoting a healthy food environment (including food systems that promote diverse, balanced, and healthy diets) requires the involvement of multiple sectors and stakeholders, including government and the public and private sectors.</p><p>Governments can play a central role in creating healthy food environments that enable people to adopt and maintain healthy eating habits. Effective actions by policymakers to create a healthy food environment include the following.</p><p>Aligning national policies and investment plans, including trade, food and agricultural policies, to promote healthy eating and protect public health by<br>Further encouraging producers and retailers to grow, use, and sell fresh fruits and vegetables.<br>Discourage the food industry from continuing or increasing production of processed foods that contain high levels of saturated fat, trans fat, free sugars, and salt/sodium.<br>Encourage the adaptation of food formulations to reduce the levels of saturated fat, trans fat, free sugars and salt/sodium with the goal of eliminating industrially produced trans fats.<br>Implement the WHO recommendations on the marketing of food and non-alcoholic beverages to children.<br>Establish standards for promoting healthy eating habits by ensuring that healthy, nutritious, safe and affordable food is available in preschools, schools, other public institutions and in the workplace.<br>Explore regulatory and voluntary tools (e.g., marketing regulations and nutrition labeling policies) and economic incentives or disincentives (e.g., taxes, subsidies) used to promote healthy eating.<br>Encourage multinational, national, and local food services and eating outlets to improve the nutritional quality of their foods, ensure the availability and affordability of healthy food options, and check portion sizes and prices.<br>Encourage consumers to make healthy food and meal requests by<br>Increasing consumer awareness of healthy eating.<br>Developing school policies and planning to encourage children to adopt and maintain healthy eating habits.<br>Educating children, adolescents, and adults about nutrition and healthy eating practices.<br>Encouraging mastery of cooking skills, including teaching them to children in schools.<br>Supporting the dissemination of information at the point of sale, including (in accordance with Codex Alimentarius Commission guidelines) the printing of appropriate nutrition labels and the inclusion of explanatory labels on the front of packages that help consumers understand and ensure that accurate, standardized and understandable information on food ingredients is provided.<br>Provide nutrition and diet counseling at primary health care facilities.<br>Promote appropriate feeding practices for infants and young children by<br>Implementing the International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes and subsequent relevant resolutions adopted by the World Health Assembly.<br>Implementing relevant policies and practices to promote the protection of working mothers<br>Promoting, protecting and supporting breastfeeding in health services and communities, including the implementation of baby-friendly hospital initiatives.<br>WHO’s response<br>The WHO Global Strategy on Diet, Physical Activity and Health was adopted by the Health Assembly in 2004 (14). The strategy calls on governments, WHO, international partners, the private sector and civil society to take action at the global, regional and local levels to promote healthy eating and physical activity.</p><p>In 2010, the Health Assembly adopted a set of recommendations on the marketing of food and non-alcoholic beverages to children (15). These recommendations can guide countries in developing new policies and improving existing policies to reduce the impact on children of the marketing of food and non-alcoholic beverages to children. WHO has also developed region-specific tools (e.g., regional nutrition profile models) for countries to implement these food marketing recommendations.</p><p>In 2012, the Health Assembly adopted a Comprehensive Maternal, Infant and Young Child Nutrition Implementation Plan and six global nutrition targets, including reducing stunting, wasting and overweight in children, improving breastfeeding, and reducing anemia and low birth weight (9).</p><p>In 2013, the Health Assembly endorsed nine voluntary global targets for the prevention and control of non-communicable diseases. These goals include halting the rise in diabetes and obesity by 2025 and reducing salt intake by 30% in relative terms. The Global Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of Non-communicable Diseases 2013-2020 (10) provides guidance and policy options to Member States, WHO and other UN agencies to achieve these targets.</p><p>The rapid rise in infant and childhood obesity now occurring in many countries led WHO to establish a Commission to End Childhood Obesity in May 2014. in 2016, the Commission produced a series of recommendations for successfully addressing childhood and adolescent obesity in different contexts around the world (16).</p><p>In November 2014, WHO and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) jointly organized the Second International Conference on Nutrition. This conference adopted the Rome Declaration on Nutrition (17) as well as a Framework for Action (18), which recommends a range of policy options and strategies to promote diverse, safe and healthy diets at all stages of life. WHO is helping countries implement the commitments made at the Second International Conference on Nutrition.</p><p>In May 2018, the Health Assembly approved the 13th Master Plan of Work, which will guide WHO’s work for the period 2019-2023 (19). Reducing salt/sodium intake and eliminating industrially produced trans-fats from the food supply have been identified in the Master Plan as part of WHO’s priority actions to achieve the goal of “ensuring healthy lifestyles for the well-being of people of all ages”. To support and facilitate Member States to accelerate the necessary actions to eliminate industrially produced trans fats, WHO has developed a roadmap for countries (i.e., the REPLACE Action Programme) (6).</p><p>References<br>(1) Hooper L, Abdelhamid A, Bunn D, Brown T, Summerbell CD, Skeaff CM.

      <title>Update on Omicron</title>
      <link href="/2021/12/07/health-7/"/>
      <url>/2021/12/07/health-7/</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Omicron update and response measures</p><a id="more"></a><p>On November 26, 2021, according to the recommendations of the WHO Technical Advisory Group on Virus Evolution (TAG-VE), the WHO designated B.1.1.529 as a variant of concern and named it Omicron. This decision is based on the evidence submitted to TAG-VE that Omicron has several mutations that may affect its behavior, such as its ease of transmission or the severity of the disease it causes. The following is a summary of what is currently known.</p><p><img src="https://s2.loli.net/2021/12/06/iJ2LuhDKfI1pm5T.png" alt="image.png"></p><p>The latest knowledge about Omega</p><p>Researchers in South Africa and around the world are conducting research to better understand many aspects of Omicron and will continue to share the findings of these studies.</p><p>Infectiousness: It is not clear whether Omega is more infectious (for example, more easily spread from person to person) compared to other variants including Delta. In South Africa affected by this mutation, the number of people who have tested positive has increased, but epidemiological studies are ongoing to understand whether this is due to Omicron or other factors.</p><p>Severity of the disease: It is not yet clear whether infection with Omicron will cause more serious disease than infection with other mutations (including Delta). Preliminary data indicate that the hospitalization rate in South Africa is rising, but this may be due to the increasing number of people infected, rather than the specific infection result of ommicron. There is currently no information that the symptoms associated with Omega are different from those of other variants. The first reported cases of infection were college students-younger people tend to be milder-but it takes days to weeks to understand the severity of the Omicron mutation. All the variants of COVID-19, including the Delta variant that dominates the world, can cause serious illness or death, especially for the most vulnerable people, so prevention is always the key.</p><p>Effectiveness of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection</p><p>Preliminary evidence suggests that compared with other issues, the risk of re-infection with Omega may be increased (that is, people who have previously been infected with COVID-19 are more likely to be re-infected with Omega), but information is limited. More information on this will be announced in the coming days or weeks.</p><p>Vaccine effectiveness: WHO is working with technical partners to understand the potential impact of this variant on our existing countermeasures, including vaccines. Vaccines remain the key to reducing serious illness and death, including targeting the major circulating variant Delta. Current vaccines are still effective against severe illness and death.</p><p>Validity of the current test: The widely used PCR test continues to detect infections, including Omega infections, and we have also seen other mutations. Research is currently underway to determine whether it has any impact on other types of tests, including rapid antigen detection tests.</p><p>Effectiveness of current treatment: Glucocorticoids and IL6 receptor blockers can still effectively manage severe COVID-19 patients. Other treatments will be evaluated to see if they are still effective because some viruses in the Omicron variant have changed.</p><p>Research in progress</p><p>Currently, WHO is coordinating with a large number of researchers around the world to better understand Omega. Research that is currently ongoing or about to be conducted includes assessment of transmission, severity of infection (including symptoms), performance of vaccines and diagnostic tests, and effectiveness of treatment.</p><p>WHO encourages countries to help collect and share data on hospitalized patients through the WHO COVID-19 clinical data platform to quickly describe clinical characteristics and patient outcomes.</p><p>More information will be announced in the coming days or weeks. WHO TAG-VE will continue to monitor and evaluate the data obtained, and evaluate how Omega’s mutation changes the behavior of the virus.</p><p>Recommended actions for countries</p><p>Since Omega has been designated as a variant of interest, WHO recommends that countries take several actions, including strengthening surveillance and case sequencing; sharing genome sequences on public databases, such as GISAID; and reporting initial cases or clusters to WHO Cases; conduct field investigations and laboratory evaluations to better understand whether Omega has different transmission or disease characteristics, or whether it affects the effectiveness of vaccines, treatments, diagnosis, or public health and social measures. For details, please see the announcement on November 26.</p><p>Countries should continue to take effective public health measures, use risk analysis and scientific methods to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in an all-round way. They should improve some public health and medical capabilities to deal with the increase in cases</p><p>On November 24, 021, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported a new variant B.1.1.529 of SARS-CoV-2. This new variant was first discovered in specimens collected in Botswana on November 11, 2021 and in South Africa on November 14, 2021.</p><p>On November 26, 2021, WHO named it B.1.1.529 Omicron and classified it as a variant of concern (VOC). On November 30, 2021, the United States designated Omicron as a variant of interest and confirmed the first confirmed case of Omicron in the United States on December 1, 2021.</p><p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been working with global public health and industry partners to learn about Omega, and we continue to monitor its progress. Throughout the pandemic, CDC has been using genome surveillance to track the mutation of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19 and to provide information for public health practices. We don’t yet know how easy it is to spread, how serious the disease it causes, or how effective existing vaccines and drugs are against it.</p><p>Although Omicron has increased its focus on Delta, Delta is still the main variant circulating in the United States.</p>]]></content>

      <title>Chinese experts say the omicron strain is similar to the flu virus: more infectious and less severe</title>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Chinese experts say the omicron strain is similar to the flu virus: more infectious and less severe</p><a id="more"></a><p>An unusual mutation in the Omicron strain has sparked a new wave of concern among experts around the world.</p><p><img src="https://s2.loli.net/2021/12/06/iJ2LuhDKfI1pm5T.png" alt="image.png"></p><p>According to foreign media reports, experts from Israel’s Hadassah Hospital said the omikron strain is more similar to the flu virus, because although it is more infectious, the symptoms of those infected are milder.</p><p>Dr. Dror Mevorach, a senior physician at Hadassa Hospital, said the Omicron strain did not appear to be so scary, and that an analysis of the latest data on infections in South Africa showed that while it was more infectious, it was not as dangerous as other variants.</p><p>The data, from omikron infections in South Africa’s hard-hit Tshwani district of Gauteng province, showed that 80 percent of those hospitalized in the past two weeks were under the age of 50, with almost all cases mild.</p><p>Mevorach noted that from the information available so far, there is reason to believe that the omicron strain is spreading rapidly, and that although a breakthrough infection has occurred, the strain is not as harmful, which seems to be good news.</p><p>According to current information, the omicron strain is more infectious but not “mild,” which is more similar to the flu virus, as some experts agree.</p><p>This also means that while more patients may emerge, they can be cured with some antiviral treatment. In addition, the vaccine could be tweaked to further boost antibodies and, hopefully, provide longer protection.</p><p>It is worth mentioning that a South African doctor revealed the process of discovering the omicron strain and noticed that a number of Omicron infected patients showed different symptoms from the previous Delta infected patients, so it attracted their attention and reported to relevant authorities, and finally discovered the strain.</p>]]></content>

      <title>Men Over 40 Can Rock to a Stronger Core</title>
      <link href="/2021/08/28/health-5/"/>
      <url>/2021/08/28/health-5/</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Men Over 40 Can Rock to a Stronger Core</p><a id="more"></a><p>Trainer, author, and fitness model Kirk Charles, NASM-CPT CES, knows that as you get older, life can get more complicated. But that shouldn’t prevent you from being on top of your game. He’ll help to answer the tough training questions that come with age so you too can be Fit Beyond 40.</p><p>I have a few older clients who are really concerned about the bulge in their midsections. Thankfully, they’re just as concerned about their backs and living a pain-free life. If you’re an older guy like me who really wants to strengthen his core, you know that crunches alone won’t do the job.</p><p>That said, there are some exercises many older men don’t feel comfortable with for fear of exacerbating any existing core, lower back, or hip problems they have, so I must give them better options. One of these is the hollow hold, one of the best core exercises you can do. When you’re ready to take it to the next level, just get rocking with a variation of the move called the hollow rock.</p><p>To set up for the exercise, you must first get into the hollow hold position. Keep in mind the key to it is driving your lower back into the floor. Lie on your back with your arms at your sides. Squeeze your abs as tight as possible, while raising your head and shoulders a few inches off the floor. Next raise your feet a few inches off the floor. finally, raise your arms toward the ceiling and gradually lower them towards the floor above your head. Your body should resemble the curve of the bottom of a rocking chair. You’re now in the hollow hold position.</p><p>Just holding the hollow hold position is tough enough for just about anyone, but once you can own it, you’re now ready to step up to the hollow rock. All you must do is slowly rock your body back and forth, just like a rocking chair. Only your lower back should make contact with the floor—don’t rock up onto your but or let your lower back lift off the ground.. To do this, your abs must be rock solid as you create the momentum with your legs and arms to get the rocking action going.</p><p>mens health mvp subscription</p><h1 id="MEN’S-HEALTH"><a href="#MEN’S-HEALTH" class="headerlink" title="MEN’S HEALTH"></a>MEN’S HEALTH</h1><p>Keep in mind you don’t want to wildly swing your arms and legs to create momentum. Small rocks back and forth do the job and maximize on your time under tension. One variation you might try is to put your arms in an offset position, where one arm is above your head and one is out to the side. This variation throws you off balance a bit and makes your abs work even harder to fight rotation.</p><p>If the hollow rock is too tough for you, work on the hollow hold a little more by holding the position progressively longer. Once you get up to the hollow hold, I suggest starting slowly by rocking back and forth only five times or so for each set. Try four to five sets and work on extending the number of rocks over time to twenty.</p>]]></content>

      <title>What Happened When This Guy Trained 30 Days to Nail a One-Arm Pullup</title>
      <link href="/2021/08/28/health-4/"/>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>What Happened When This Guy Trained 30 Days to Nail a One-Arm Pullup</p><a id="more"></a><p>Brandon William is always looking for the next best way to challenge his body and fitness, from 30-day challenges to remarkable feats of strength and endurance. He’s previously challenged himself to train like a gymnast, give up sugar for 30 days, and even did 1 hour of pullups wearing a 30-pound vest. For his latest stunt, he challenged himself to master the one-arm pullup.</p><p>“The one-arm pullup is one of the most difficult calisthenics skills you can possibly learn,” he says.</p><p>He also notes that this move can take the average person up to a year to learn—but he’s giving himself 30 days to nail the exercise. To start, he did some research on how some other people trained to learn how to pull off the movement. Combined with his own calisthenics knowledge, he created a training routine to set him up for success.</p><p>“Risk of injury and developing tendonitis is quite high,” he says. So to avoid that, for each training session (2 to 3 times a week), he is focusing on just 3 different exercises:</p><p>Weighted Pullups (4 sets of 8 to 12 reps)<br>Assisted One-Arm Pullups (4 sets of 3 to 5 reps)<br>Static One-Arm Pullup Hold (4 sets of max reps)<br>Before he starts training, he attempts to do a one-arm pullup on each arm to get a baseline of his strength. He can’t pull off the movement with either arm.</p><p>“That is not easy. That is tough… I was not expecting it to be this difficult,” he says.</p><p>mens health mvp subscription<br>MEN’S HEALTH<br>The next day he start his training, going in with the weighted pullups using a 55 pound weight chained around his waist, followed by the rest of the workout. After Day 1, he already had calluses. For Day 2, he switched his grip to a neutral one for the weighted pullups to help himself finish the reps. By Day 15, he still felt like he wasn’t progressing very much at all. So he called pro climber and fellow YouTuber Magnus Midtbø to get some advice.</p><p>Midtbø poses the question to William about which part of the pull up he struggles most with: the first or last part. Midtbø suggests that William practices ‘locking off’ (i.e. static holds) on his arm and holding himself there at just about 90 degrees, working his way up to a 10 second hold. From there, he should work on negative pullups.</p><p>This was the key. William also adds in Archer Pullups to his training, and by Day 30, he’s ready to test his strength. On his first attempt, he misses the rep by just one inch. But on the second, he nails it… but kicks his camera on the way up, which meant he needed to do a third attempt and final attempt. And his hard work paid off, because he crushed it on the third try.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Olympic Marathoner Ryan Hall Shared the 7 Most Important Things to Do the Night Before a Big Race</p><a id="more"></a><p>Ryan Hall made history as a runner, becoming the first American to break the hour barrier in the half-marathon. Since retiring from pro running in 2016, he has packed on the muscle and is now able to deadlift more than 500 pounds—while still holding onto his record as the fastest American runner of all time in the half and full marathon categories.</p><p>Hall’s wife Sara, meanwhile, continues to kill it as an elite distance runner; she was the first American in over a decade to reach the podium at last year’s London Marathon. Today, Sara is competing in a half-marathon race in Eugene, and in a post shared to Instagram last night, Hall broke down the seven most important things that they have both learned over the years about how to best prepare for a long-distance race.</p><p>First off, Hall recommends lying down rather than sitting wherever possible. “Sitting creates all kinds of tightness and kinks that you want to avoid pre-race,” he says</p><p>Secondly: eat up. A common pitfall is to not consume enough calories to keep you going when the time comes. “Don’t be afraid to eat,” he says. “Remember that you are fueling today for tomorrow’s race.” He also advises to “keep your food simple,” suggesting white meat and egg whites as good sources of protein and white rice and pasta as simple carb sources, as well as to keep your electrolytes up, “as they are needed not only for holding water/hydration but also for your muscles to neurologically fire.”</p><p>This content is imported from Instagram. You may be able to find the same content in another format, or you may be able to find more information, at their web site.</p><p>He also urges you to stay away from hot tubs as they can “leave legs feeling jello-y”, and says it’s perfectly normal to not sleep very well the night before a big race.</p><p>Finally, he says, be sure to enjoy yourself. “Reminding myself of this reality takes the pressure off and reminds me to soak it all in and enjoy every part of the experience,” he says. “I’ve found, when I am having the most fun is when I’m usually performing the best.”</p>]]></content>

      <title>The 8 best Sunscreen sticks recommended by dermatologists for easy SPF application</title>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>They’re perfect for both hard-to-reach areas and on-the-go coverage.</p><a id="more"></a><p>Even though applying sunscreen should be a part of your daily routine 365 days a year, if you associate anything with summer, it’s probably SPF. Whether you’re spending afternoons lounging poolside, going for a long hike, or just making a quick run to the store, protecting your skin from ultraviolet rays is key to preventing skin cancer, premature aging, and dark spots. But lathering on lotion can leave you feeling sticky, which is especially unideal for a day at the beach (read: sand. everywhere.).</p><p>Enter: Sunscreen sticks, the perfect solution to protecting skin while keeping application easy and clean. “I love stick sunscreens, especially when they are physical blockers, as they give excellent protection and can be targeted to areas of use,” board-certified dermatologist Purvisha Patel, MD, tells Health, noting that they are safe alternatives to traditional SPFs. “The formulation is thicker and easier to apply in an even fashion versus lotions and creams. SPF sticks are also super portable; just throw them in your purse or backpack and go.</p><p>The best sunscreen sticks you can buy:<br>​​Best Overall: Supergoop Sunnyscreen 100% Mineral Stick<br>Best Drugstore: Cetaphil Sheer Mineral Sunscreen Stick<br>Best Sport: Bare Republic Mineral Sport Sunscreen Stick<br>Best WIthout White Cast: Shiseido Clear Sunscreen Stick SPF 50+<br>Best Reef-Safe: Beauty by Earth SPF Mineral Sunscreen Stick<br>Best for Face: Supergoop Glow Stick SPF 50<br>Best for Sensitive Skin: Aveeno Positively Mineral Sensitive Skin Daily Sunscreen Stick<br>Best for Kids: Blue Lizard Kids Mineral Sunscreen Stick<br>How do sunscreen sticks work?<br>Unlike sunscreen sprays—with which you can end up with more of the product in the air than on your skin—sunscreen sticks seamlessly glide over skin to ensure proper and thorough application and can help protect the delicate skin near your eyes, since they don’t run.  “They leave a more uniform layer of protection on the skin because they are stickier and harder to rub off,” Dr. Patel continues.</p><p>But, stick sunscreen users need to be particularly diligent about how much they apply. “Stick sunscreen is easy to apply but also easy to underapply,” Canada-based dermatologist Geeta Yadav, MD, explains. “The American Academy of Dermatology recommends people pass stick sunscreen back and forth across the desired area four times for proper coverage.” And like with lotion and spray forms, you should reapply a layer every two hours, or after a swimming or sweating session. </p><p>For Debra Jaliman, MD, professor of dermatology at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York City and author of Skin Rules, you should target areas that are more prone to burning. </p><p>“You can also apply them on the ears or nose, and they’re good easy-to-miss spots like the ankles,” she points out. </p><p>What to consider when choosing a sunscreen stick<br>Regardless of your skin type, it’s important to pay close attention to the ingredients list—starting with the type of UV ray blockers inside. “Those with sensitive skin should opt for physical sunscreens containing titanium or zinc oxide to avoid sensitivity issues,” explains Dr. Patel. “Chemical sunscreens can be irritating to those with dry or sensitive skin, as the chemicals can be irritating.” Sunscreen sticks with “strong fragrances, or essential oils such as ingredients with botanicals” can also irritate sensitive skin, she warns. In fact, “they can cause contact allergic reactions, and can increase some people’s sensitivity to the sun.”  </p><p>Dr. Patel also notes that acne-prone SPF wearers should be particularly mindful of the formulas they’ve chosen, adding, “Most stick sunscreens have a thicker vehicle. This is great for children, but can clog pores on faces for those with acne.” Opting for an oil-free and non-comedogenic SPF stick will typically help you avoid breakouts. Dr. Patel also recommends avoiding “sunscreen sticks with coconut oil or olive oil on your face and body, as they can increase breakouts if you get sweaty.”</p><p>Ahead, the best sunscreen sticks to try for your next outing or outdoor adventure.</p><p>RELATED: These Are the Best Sunscreens for Your Face, According to Dermatologists</p><p>Best Overall: Supergoop Sunnyscreen 100% Mineral Stick<br>Supergoop</p><p>CREDIT: COURTESY OF MERCHANT<br>Just because this pediatrician-approved sunscreen stick is designed with kiddos in mind, doesn’t mean that you can’t use it, too.

Plus, the formula is surprisingly hydrating.” </p><p>“I used this sunscreen on my five-year-old’s face while at the beach and it worked perfectly,” wrote one reviewer. “He has very sensitive skin which often causes him to have to take a break from the sun; not with this sunscreen.” </p><p>To buy: Supergoop Sunnyscreen 100% Mineral Stick, $24, supergoop.com</p><p>Best Drugstore: Cetaphil Sheer Mineral Sunscreen Stick<br>Sunscreen Stick for Face &amp; Body</p><p>CREDIT: AMAZON<br>“Cetaphil’s Sunscreen Stick is a wonderful drugstore option,” notes Dr. Yadav. “Not only does it use exclusively mineral-based sunscreens and offer a high protection factor, but also is water resistant for up to 80 minutes and noncomedogenic.” This easy-to-glide and irritant-free formula is gentle on all skin types and is formulated with vitamin E and other skin conditioners to replenish moisture, which translates to a healthy skin barrier.  </p><p>“I love this product,” raved one customer. “I am a teacher and it allows me to keep my face protected at recess.

      <title>WHO Statement on advancing the next series of studies to find the origins of SARS-CoV-2</title>
      <link href="/2021/05/26/health-1/"/>
      <url>/2021/05/26/health-1/</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>WHO Statement on advancing the next series of studies to find the origins of SARS-CoV-2</p><a id="more"></a><p>Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, WHO has been working with Member States and the scientific community to better understand how this pandemic began so that we can be better prepared for the next one. </p><p><img src="https://i.loli.net/2021/08/17/9PcpR4TEMnAmrgG.png" alt="image.png"></p><p>Following the publication of the WHO-China joint report of the phase one studies on the origins of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in March 2021, WHO has outlined the next series of studies that need to be undertaken and continues to be in discussions with Member States and experts on next steps. </p><p>To move forward, WHO calls for all governments to depoliticize the situation and cooperate to accelerate the origins studies, and importantly to work together to develop a common framework for future emerging pathogens of pandemic potential. </p><p>WHO’s priority is for scientists to build on the first phase of studies, implement the recommendations outlined in the March 2021 report and accelerate scientific efforts on all hypotheses. Searching for the origins of any novel pathogen is a difficult process, which is based on science, and takes collaboration, dedication and time. </p><p>WHO reiterates that the search for the origins of SARS-CoV-2 is not and should not be an exercise in attributing blame, finger-pointing or political point-scoring. It is vitally important to know how the COVID-19 pandemic began, to set an example for establishing the origins of all future animal-human spillover events. </p><p>Countries have a collective responsibility to work together in the true spirit of partnership and to ensure scientists and experts have the space they need to find the origins of the worst pandemic in a century. Building on what has already been learned, the next series of studies would include a further examination of the raw data from the earliest cases and sera from potential early cases in 2019. Access to data is critically important for evolving our understanding of science and should not be politicised in any way. </p><p>WHO is working with a number of countries that have reported detection of SARS-CoV-2 in samples from stored biological specimens from 2019. For example, in Italy, WHO facilitated an independent evaluation by international laboratories of the findings of one such study, which included the blind retesting of pre-pandemic blood samples. Sharing raw data and giving permission for the retesting of samples in labs outside of Italy reflects scientific solidarity at its best and is no different from what we encourage all countries, including China, to support so that we can advance the studies of the origins quickly and effectively. </p><p>The International Scientific Advisory Group for Origins of Novel Pathogens, or SAGO, is a new advisory group for WHO, which will be responsible for advising WHO on the development of a global framework to systematically study the emergence of future emerging pathogens with pandemic potential. For SARS-CoV-2, it will support the rapid undertaking of recommended studies outlined in the March 2021 report. </p><p>By issuing an open call for nominations to SAGO, WHO is providing a transparent foundation for the new scientific advisory group that we expect all Member States will engage with. WHO hopes for continuity from previous missions to China for SARS-CoV-2, as well as other missions studying the origins of, for example, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, avian influenza, Lassa and Ebola.   </p><p>This open call aims to ensure that a broad range of scientific skills and expertise are identified to advise WHO on the studies needed to identify the origins of any future emerging or re-emerging pathogen of pandemic potential. </p><p>China and a number of other Member States have written to WHO regarding the basis for further studies of the SARS-CoV-2 “lab hypothesis.” They have also suggested the origins study has been politicised, or that WHO has acted due to political pressure. </p><p>On review of the phase one study report, WHO determined that there was insufficient scientific evidence to rule any of the hypotheses out. Specifically, in order to address the “lab hypothesis,” it is important to have access to all data and consider scientific best practice and look at the mechanisms WHO already has in place. WHO is only focused on science, providing solutions and building solidarity.</p><p>Smallpox is the only human virus to have ever been eradicated. There are two countries in the world that keep stocks of smallpox in secure labs: Russia and the US. Inspections by the WHO biosafety team of VECTOR and CDC smallpox labs occur every two years, most recently in Jan-Feb 2019 (VECTOR) and May 2019 (CDC). A report is then provided to the World Health Assembly and the inspection reports are published on the WHO website. </p><p>Analysing and improving lab safety and protocols in all laboratories around the world, including in China, is important for our collective biosafety and security.</p><p>Searching for the origins of a novel virus is an immensely difficult scientific task that takes time. WHO is committed to following the science, and we call on all governments to put differences aside and work together to provide all data and access required so that the next series of studies can be commenced as soon as possible.</p>]]></content>
